         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Israel adm [Music] [Music] le here. Oh Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Praise be the name of his glorious sovereignty forever and ever. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them thoroughly to your children. And you shall speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them for a sign upon your hand. And they shall be for a reminder between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and upon your gates. When the word entered the world, freedom entered it. Torah exists only to establish peace. And its highest teaching is love and kindness. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and what is not to and that is the whole Torah. Go learn it. Honoring one another, doing acts of kindness, and making peace. These are our highest duties. is equal to them. So let us learn in order to teach. Let us learn in order to do. She is a tree of life to those who hold fast. All who cling to her find happiness. Her ways are ways of pleasantness. And all her paths are peace. Help us to return to you Lord. Then truly shall we return. Renew the days of our first love. Amen. Together. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Let us not enter into testing, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. Vicki Shekarta Rabba. Thankful is what I am before your face. Okay. Living and eternal for restoring my soul within me with compassion. Great is your faithfulness. Turn to someone and say Shabbat shalom. And have a seat and we'll get started. I've got just a real uh quick few announcements. Uh one of them remember every Tuesday uh we have prayer time at 1. On Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:30 we have mana time for seniors. Uh of course we've had a roshana service. We're still having our yomapor service and our soot service right here uh starting next Wednesday night. Uh, as you know, the year has now begun and our new calendar that has both audio and video built in through QR codes. It's good all the way to 2027 is now available. Uh, the America at War Book is available at half price. And then lastly, I want everyone to know about our Jordan Saudi Arabia tour next year in 2026. Now, I think I've got my volume up. I hope. Here we go. Uh, here are some people. I got some videos of them celebrating Roaches Shana. Here it is up in Alaska. That's Paul and Donna Claus in company. That's a long breath. And then here we have in Kenya, this is in Nairobi, Kenya. I don't know why the video went out, but [Music] can we celebrate the Lord for the Amen. Okay, now look at this. This well is completed at the Jerusalem church. All right. And Jill, I'm not sure if you have Francis's uh Yeah, we got it. USB ready. Come on up, Francis. We have Francis here all the way from Kenya. Yay. Woohoo. Give us an update on what is going on in Kenya. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. Thank you, daddy. Yes. Uh yeah, this is the day that the Lord has made and we have we will rejoice in it. Yeah, this is uh our partnership with Elsadai Ministries here in the US. And today I'm standing here to appreciate and uh uh speak a blessing from all I bring all the greetings from Kenya. Yay. Not only Kenya but from Masai Mara. You see um this everything began here when uh Papa Mark and Bill came to our village and this is where they stayed. This is our village. This is our home and you see we are standing in a in a mountain and it was I just it started when I went to Israel and this uh church sponsored me through El Shadai Ministries to go to Israel. So my trip to Israel was a blessing to us and uh so before that uh this is where we we used to draw water. This is a small pond and we take water from here to and clean it like doing um putting some chlorine on it and after that we put into small buckets and drink. So here this is the water we uh that's the drinking water. That's the drinking water. So we drink this water always. This is in my compound. This is what we used. Our donkeys get inside there. our cows, our dogs, everything. They anyone with a quench when you want to quench your thirst, you just go there, drink, take the cup, take it. But guess what? When Pastor M came and see this and say, \"Lord, it's an incense, we're going to do something.\" So we started from there. So this is the the well that started just beside the small pond you saw and this is the tongue now 20,000 liters up it's already changed a place is so changed so let's go to the next point yeah this is the team this is the church that I I pastor here uh we have um Nashai is our sister from Canada and Papa and uh and me and Bill. So this is the church that they teach. This is the second teaching area when uh then uh from here we went to Jerusalem church which you saw there are this is a this is the Jerusalem church. the the Jerusalem church looks like that and that is a village where uh pastor Mark taught about the Torah. So and we thank God for for you all. Let's go to the next point. The project started from there. This is a distribution of our Bibles and all these kids are preparing for form four. They are going the last year at the high school to go to the to prepare themselves to the university. So it was a team of 100 students and we give everyone a Bible. So, so from uh three of our churches, these students uh I started with them since they were kids and now they are over 18. So, they are running to the next level. So, we started here and that's why they have uh a vision. they written in their t-shirts. We have a vision to take the Torah to nations and inside this I'm training about uh 20 20 missionaries. You have identified places like uh Ethiopia, Northern Kenya, Tanzania. I started training them from low. So I really thank God that we can uh teach them and we are praying that God is going to change for the last 21 years that I've been pastoring across this small region. I want to change the hearts and raise missionaries for the next generation. So these are the children the young girls that I saved them from uh FGM uh the Masai people they have they still have that such kind but now it's a bit silent the they do female general modulation but I saved them and over 80 of them are going to universities high school and that is a celebration then the parents came following them so the parent receive a Bible and the child receive a Bible and they gave me a blanket. Yeah. So they bring that's what they can they can give me. So they they did that. Let's go to the next level. Yeah. This is Jerusalem church. Jerusalem church. It's like you can see over 20 to to 30 kilometers away. And people here they have no water. the there's a small stream that they dig so that when the water flows in the in the river. Thank you my brother Max. And uh so the flowing river will have some little ponds. In every stop there is a pond. In every stop there is a pond. So that's when the the place is dry no rain they go to little ponds. And when Elshadai Ministries president came to our village, it changed everything. There is uh another 10,000 liter tank on top and the the the well is done finished. They started drinking water. This mind-blowing like the the man here we call him Abraham in the Jerusalem church. This old man had four wives and of um 20some children. He said, \"I don't need land for the children for the people to go to church because her uh one of her daughters got sick and the hand had a problem and I prayed and she got healed totally.\" So that is how we got this land. So we got a land and now we have a church on it. Yeah. So and the field is very fertile for this world. We will start training what I saw in Israel about agriculture. This is what we going to do for sustainability and people to have to know how to to do to harvest and uh so that our water will be productive beside drinking and uh and washing clothes and everything else. We're going to teach. We're going to welcome anyone with the skills of of agriculture, horiculture, all that we can teach because we have 80,000 liters per 10 hours. So 8,000 liters per hour. So every 10 hours which the solar because we have a solar, we don't have the the electricity running. So we have we use the solar. So these people here and everyone who has given to this we have a solar. So no day that we can say it has stopped because of paying or anything the solar is up. So everything is running. So when we have this we will go forward. Yeah. So next picture please. Yeah. Uh this lady is the single Messiah lady which I pray we prayed for at the GPS. God did you see that? And uh she's working with the prison. We worked with her for 8 years um reaching prisons and in this prison this is the first time she came to the area and this is interesting. No single Masai lady is in prison. Only 1% in the whole country in Kenya and Tanzania. They have done a research and there is almost zero crimes in in the area where the Masai lives. Yeah. There's no police. There are no police. There's no crime. It's like zero. So that's why the conservations, the animals and all that. We appreciate God or uh also for our fathers like they put everything in place because um learning Torah it's like we have a justice system very working very nicely and we have um a conflict resolution system which is done by elders, women or moran or young people. So they have a level. If you do something beyond the level of elders, then they can just hunt you to the police and that's it. But if you your crime slowly slowly they have the chiefs and other people they have a very nice justice system and um I've been in that um part doing that resolution. If someone has done something which we can solve it. Yeah. By crimes that which are not so bad. So we do that. So these people uh I went here preaching the gospel and also distributing Bibles from here. This lady was went to find people to to help on sanitary sanitary towels, toilet papers because you see the children their their mothers are in prison but the children they cannot separate. So they can the children stay in prison. They stay too in prison. So they have a single uh a way of taking children to land somewhere. But their mothers are been convicted. Some has a serious crime, big ones. But the child is not excluded because so they are almost like everything. So they are churches who partner to give milk uh learning materials, pencils or pens and we give them. So I've been doing this even before. So reaching them, praying for them and teaching uh the gospel and I got an opportunity uh when uh this church came the president under director everyone when they visited we went to a place and I found something to bring to them. Guess what? I found a lady here that she was conficted for 5 years. What happened? I said everyone to say his prayer prayer request and the lady said this is we have a water problem in this prison and I have only three months to leave and everyone was saying oh pray for my case to end pray for every any other problem. I want to see my people. I want to see my parents. I want to see my mother. I want to see my father. I want to see this. I left my car home. You know these people. But one single person said it's a problem because they they go to the river to draw water. All the guards and the prisoners, the inmates. But yeah, the guards are not excluded. They go all to the water and they take bath. Pastor Mark was there. We went to the river across the road and a lady from Canada just bathed in the river because we didn't have bathrooms. So he just like did that and this is what they do. So and when I shared the picture with pastor Mark he said tell them that prayer is answered. This prison was started as a concentration camp in 1952 50. In 1952 it became a prison and up to now they don't have a single well. They go to a Mara river draw water and bring it in buckets every two days. So now we have a well. Let me jump in there a second. What's amazing that lady, she gets out in three months from the jail. Yeah. Her prayer was that the prison would get a well even though she won't be helped by it, but that was her goal. And now we have a prison with a well. Yeah. And through this, the Kenyan government through the permanent secretary of the prisons all of Kenya signed a letter for me to to do uh prison ministry. So when papa you come, we go to the biggest prison in Kenya. The big Yeah. So just because we put the well at the prison, the government has given us free access to every prison. I mean that's just yeah they don't they they uh they they really the government don't allow any picture to be taken through the prisons but because of wellw wishes we use this for what we are doing today. So many people are happy for that. Okay, let's see. Go to the next one. Yeah. Uhhuh. This is Yes. This is a the prison god. Yeah. The prison god and this is the leader and our the lady is leading the other side. Yeah. Oh. Ah. This Yeah. This is the well. This is it the day. So, we're really happy. This guy is the one who did the geological survey. And this is the day you see this uh man is uh the prison chaplain. Yeah, the prison chaplain. But every person is trained. They don't allow any civilian to preach there. But I found an opportunity. I don't have any training military history. But I do I do the best. Yeah. And this is what happened. 400 people 450. We had only 50 people who are Christians. But by the end of this sermon, all the 400 were crying. 400. Glory to God. Let's go to the next one. Next slide. Yeah. The I think that Yes. Oh my goodness. You Oh, this one. You can't miss this. I met this old man three years ago and two of his sons died because one died through a bullet and the other one died through um an elephant hit. And this old village, they live in northern Kenya. So that's Muslim area. Yeah, this is Muslim area and it's the only village without a mosque. Yeah, these are these are Masai speaking people in northern Kenya. So they they are and they are exploited. They are almost assimulated by Muslims. That's this is those homes I showed you with the wood sticks and clothes over it. Yes. That's the people that live up there. Yes, that is the people live up there. So, we we will we will we are praying I've been praying for the last two years about this after corona. I visited there and now we are praying that we they can get water for this village because this is the only thing they have abandoned two abandoned schools and uh I went there. There is um some photos for the school which is closed there. The government is giving them teachers uh but books, pencils and bros they don't they don't buy for them. The parents should buy and here nothing growing. Cows go very far because they are pastoralist and we are praying for this village. They were really desperate. That is how they live. Yeah. I lived in this homes some years back but now the Masai there are still Masai people who live like this but this one is so much Yeah. This is next slide. Yeah. Next one. Next slide. Yeah. Mhm. This is uh our suahili bibles in Korea which we gave in the in Tanzania Tanzanian border. Tanzanian border. The pastor that we are working with is a teacher. So he's uh he's he's is working with the children with the government. So to me I have more I'm I'm free. I'm a missionary. So I don't have nothing to to wait. Where they say go, I go and they come, I come. Yeah. Yes. I am in the through the this church. Now I am in the Bible society. This is the director and they are using my picture in the Bible society for the Masai Bibles. They so they are using my picture because now we bought over 2,000 which is not which is it's not a simple thing to buy such a great This is a Masai village. We went to see the Morans. The Morans are like a kind of protection for the Masai people. It's a process. It's an initiative process which they go before they do the initiation they go for Moran. After the initiation they become morans and they they experience and learn about Masai people. So and through this we went to the Amanata. These are homes with this small sticks. I I wish for home. Yeah these are homes. This is where they live. The children here they they are nursing children. So they are their mothers are here. Their fathers are here and we are here. and they didn't allow to preach the gospel because it's it's it's a total different uh culture but through uh God's grace I had an opportunity to do that. You see these are houses like the same one but in the other area it's very dry. So going to let's go do Yes. So we took water with a tank with a tractor. So this is what we did. Sugar, water, and Bibles same day. Thank you. Go ahead. Yeah. These are people who are appreciating about the Bibles.

Then they all received their Bibles. Is that amazing? Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you all for such a blessing. This is uh the pence in the village in in the northern village. So we thank God for that. Thank you very much for your prayers and support. Thank you daddy. I appreciate everything. That's why yeah for the last 15 years I've been waiting for a day like this since I knew Mark back in those years. Yeah. in uh back 2010 up to date and one single visit has changed my life and my village. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Go ahead. You go ahead. Uh what a blessing to have him here uh with us. Let's see. All right. Now, one thing I wanted to mention before we set up and worship. How many of you have ever heard of the Tower of Babel? Okay. If you remember what that was, uh this was after the flood. And this is mankind's uh response to God. It's like, you want to go to war, God? Let's go to war, you know. Well, as many of you know, Tower of Babel represents all the nations coming together against God. Well, this last week here we have the uh European Union recognizing the state of Palestine and it's like they're raising their fist. But here this last week of course we have or the last few weeks we've had the total uh lunar eclipse. We've had the solar eclipse and I believe this is God is saying he's about to bring his fist down uh on the rest of the world that are want to divide his land. What I think it's fascinating is many of you have heard of the ring of fire that goes all the way around the Pacific uh ocean. For the first time in history, this last July saw the largest number of earthquakes over the magnitude of seven in a single month. In just this last July, there was a 7.3, 7.4, 7.0, and an 8.8. All in July. The next month was the month of Alul with the lunar eclipse. The next month was Tishry with the solar eclipse. Well, what do we see in August? There was a 7.5. In September, a 7.4. September 18th, the 7.8. And what does the Lord do in the middle of all of that? He brings in the uh lunar eclipse, the solar eclipse. And so, and right in the middle of that, God trying to speak to the nations. We have a tower babble response with the EU. putting their fist up saying, \"We're going to divide your land. We are in charge, not you.\" See, God is the one who created all the borders for all the nations. It says, \"All right. Well, now the EU says the UN and we get to determine where borders are.\" So, this is a real in-your-face thing to God. Well, what is fascinating is when you get on God's time schedule, I'll have you know right now we time wise every row represents seven years. There's one year, two years, three, four, five, well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is called a schmita week. Seven years. All right? And there's seven going down. But I want you to notice here we are. Uh now this was in uh yeah 2013 2016 tower of babel being uh built toward the end of the first cycle well of a jubilee year. I think it's fascinating. Here's where Abraham receives the promise on Passover. But it was right here when Abraham exits Babylon and he comes to the promised land right here. He but then he goes down to Egypt, returns to Canaan, separates from Lot. Lot's captured, encounters Mechisedc, and then it's right here. He receives uh the promise on Passover, and it was a schmita year. So, the Schmidita years are very important. We're going to take a look at that more later. Uh but we also have our Genesis book with the 5-hour Hebrew audio download. It comes along with it. We also have our gospel book uh that is now available. And we have our uh part two from Acts to Revelation. Should be here in about 6 weeks. And right here is what it looks like inside. Here we have not only the Gospels, but the rest of the New Testament coming in Hebrew with the transliteration. With that said, let's stand. Had a long announcements this time, but hey, what can I say? We enjoyed having Francis with us. Amen. All right. Lord Ainu Moanu, our father, our king. We just thank you so much for everything you're doing in each one of our lives. And right now, Lord, I just pray that you would give every single one of us eyes to see, ears to hear, and a heart to understand in Yeshua's name. Amen.

Uh for some reason, this is the second week in a row we've had a problem with Facebook, but we have people on YouTube that are watching and of course on our live stream, but right now we have people watching from all 50 states including Canada, India, Netherlands, Australia, the UK, the Virgin Islands, Kenya, Nigeria, Cayman Islands, all over. Yay. Well, so excited. Okay, today the Torah portion is vi which means and he went. This is referring to our uh opening verse here in Deuteronomy 31:1. And Moses went and he's speaking to all of Israel. And look what he said. Today's my birthday. And he is 120 years old. So it's a happy birthday. And for Moses that was on the seventh day of the month of Adar. And in Deuteronomy 31 6-8 he's telling all of Israel to be strong and of a good courage. Don't fear. Don't be afraid because they're about to go in and take the promised land. Too many people walk in a spirit of fear. Yes. I'm serious. They just walk in a spirit of fear. What in the world are you afraid of? You know, I tell you what, this this life is a vapor. It's a wind. It passes away. If you don't believe in an afterlife, oh my gosh, I would be full of fear. But if you realize dying is just changing clothes, that's all it is, you know. And I am not here for this world anyway. I'm passing through. And so for me, uh, my I don't want to say the greatest fear is not getting the mission done God's called me to do. Before I go, I say, God, don't take me out till I've at least accomplished what you've want me to accomplish. And but then he says, God will not fail you. He won't forsake you. And then Moses calls Joshua and says in front of everybody, be strong and of a good courage. Okay? God's going to go with you into this promised land. And he says, \"God is not going to fail you. He's not going to forsake you. So don't be afraid.\" Now, here's what's amazing. Look at Deuteronomy 3:19. Moses wrote the Torah. He delivered it to the priests that bore the ark of the covenant. And he puts this book into the Ark of the Covenant. Now, look at Deuteronomy 17:15. I'm going to jump back a few chapters. Moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years, you hear that? At the end of every seven years, in a year of release, okay, what is that called? Schmita year. It's a schmita week, which means a week of seven years. And the seventh year is the Schmita year. And so God says at the end of every seven years in the year of release, but look at what day it is to be done on. What day does it say? You guys know English. It's on your notes. Okay. Feast of tabernacles. What day do you proclaim the year of Jubilee? I mean, what day? What day do you proclaim the year of Jubilee? Yamapore. So Yom Kapor every 50 years on Yomkapor you declare the year of jubilee but every seven years you proclaim the year of liberty on the feast of tabernacle. So yum kapor is jubilee tabernacles is every seventh year. That's going to be important to remember and you'll see why in a minute. Okay let's see. Oh, I skipped Deuteronomy 17:15. Look at this. God says, \"When you come into the land the Lord your God has given you, you possess it. You dwell in it, and you're going to say, I want a king like all the nations.\" God says, \"You shall surely set a king over you, but it has to be the one that God chooses. From one among your brethren, you shall set as king. You may not set a foreigner who is not your brother.\" So, what does that mean? They can't have a Hittite be the king of Israel. They can't have an Ammonite, a Moabitete, an Edomite. Okay, got that? I mean, that would make sense, you would think. Okay, now look at this. In Deuteronomy 31:10-12, it says it has to be done in the seventh year on the Feast of Tabernacles and the place God chooses, which is Jerusalem. you have to read this Torah before all of Israel in their hearing. Now, that's not the entire five books, but there was sections that they had to read, which was very important, and you will see why. It says, \"You have to read it before all of Israel in their hearing, gather everyone together, the men, the women, the children, your stranger.\" Who would have the authority to do that? The king. No one else has the authority to tell everyone you drop what you're doing and you come here right now on this day and we're going to read this. Okay. And so that is called does anyone know that what that's called every seven years when the king comes together and says everybody to come. It's called the hakeel. Hakl. That's what it means. everyone comes together and then the king would stand up and he would read certain sections of the Torah. Well, look at this. Jeremiah is like 500 years later. Well, a thousand years from Moses, 500 years from David. And look what it says in Jeremiah 34:13-15. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought him out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And now he's quoting what we just read in Deuteronomy. He says at the end of seven years, every man has to set free his Hebrew brother who's been sold. When he serves six, you're to let him go free. But look at this. Your fathers never did obey me. And now you recently turned and did what...",

If you have your Bibles, please turn with me to the book of John, the Gospel of John, chapter 4. We're going to read a very long pass portion of scripture today. So, I will not ask you to start because you get tired. In our home, we normally read through the Bible and we normally do rotation. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. N. Others have done the hard work and you have the benefits of their labor. Verse 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony. He told me everything I ever needed. So when Samitas came to him, they asked him to stay with them and he stayed 2 days and because of these words maybe more believers. They say to the woman, we no longer believe just because of what you said. Now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world. Our God and our father, we thank you because of this message that you have prepared us for us today. As I deliver this message, I pray for clarity. Oh, I pray for courage. I pray for confidence. I pray for your inspiration that you may use me. I also pray for the listeners this morning that God you may open their hearts that they may receive this message. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. I will title the message this morning spreading the gospel. Spreading the gospel. It is one of the neglected ministries in the church today. It is one of the ministries that is not emphasized today. I'm asking when did you last share the gospel to anyone in the past few years? I don't want you to raise your hands but ask yourself why did you share the gospel? Why did you ask somebody to receive Jesus? Those of us sitting here this morning, have you led anyone to Christ? Have you led anyone to Christ? If you are sincere enough, I think very many few months would go up because if that was the case, we would not have a room for the people in churches today. So it's true that it's not it's a ministry that has been even me I don't remember the last time I spoke about witnessing to sharing the gospel the last year when we were about to open the church we organized for doortodoor evangelism and open air crusade and actually it became an eye opener to us. We realized how he equipped our people are to do the right to witness. Majority of the banks that we moved around were actual visitors but our old members were perishing. So it is indicating that that area is lacking. We have so many departments in this church. We have the praise and worship. who have just led us in a wonderful session of worship. We have the choir, we have the usher who are doing a wonderful job there. We have the security, we have the project department, we have the missions. But it's unfortunate that we don't have a strong and vibrant outreach empowerment in our church. How we hope to grow if we don't reach out to our community. How we hope to fulfill the great commission if we don't share the gospel. Sharing the gospel is a command. We are not commanded to seek. We are not commanded to do all these other mysteries. But when Jesus actually finished his work on earth, he left one command to the disciples. He told them, \"Go preach the good news to the whole world.\" That is a command that we've given. We call it the great commission. But some people have said this is the great omission. We have omitted the great work that God has called us. So this morning using the story that we have read our challenge each one of us to take up this great mission that God has given us to share the good news. In this very long text, Apostle John actually did it deliberately. This is the longest conversation that Jesus had with anybody. He did not even have a long conversation with disciples the way he did to this woman. And the writer of this text decided to record it. However long it is, he recorded it because it is very important. It is very important. Number two, the position of this story is also very important. It was after chapter 3. In chapter 3 of the book of John, there is another conversation. This time it was conversation with Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a Jews religious leader, a very friendship and a very rich man. The Bible say he came to Jesus at night and had a conversation with him about issues with eternal life. And then chapter four another conversation with a nameless we are not given the name of this American woman. We are not told but by the description she was a noble. So we are coming from a very influential leader to a noble which is an indication that John wanted to let us know that Jesus is concerned about all of them. He's concerned about the rich intellectual the religious leaders just the way he's concerned with the people who are nobodyies in society. And the last part which this text is important is it addresses the fundamental truth of the scripture that Jesus came to seek and to save the lost soul that is his mission. So out of this text we can know those three parts. Now as we go through this story that's why I deliberately read the whole text because there are so many lessons that we can learn about reaching out. And today I'm going to take you through very quickly on six lessons that we can learn from this. Something that we can learn about reaching out to those who are reaching out to the gospel. The first thing that we see here is about barriers. Barriers in the gospel. We see this in verse 9. Verse 9 um says the Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a king. I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a dream?\" These were two people who are already facing some barrier and there are about three barriers here. Number one, there is a cultural barrier. The Jews and the Samaritans had different cultures and it emanated from what happened in 722 BC when the nation of Israel was taken into captivity. All the young men, women, ablebodied people were taken captiv captivity. The land was left almost empty. Very old and sick and people could not go the distance were left behind. Now the empty land was later occupied by foreigners who came to settle and they intermarried with the remnants the people who were made and as a result a new group of people emerged. People were not fully Jews and they were not fully Gentiles. They had a little element of Jews culture and a little element of Jews of Gentile culture. So when the other two years back they found this corrupted corrupted culture corrupted religion and there is a rift that developed between these two. So they could not agree and therefore gentile not gentiles but Samaritans and Jews were not relating in any way. So when Jesus talked to this woman she was surprised. You are a Jew. How how can you do this? How can you speak to me? You are you are of a different culture. Number two is that this was a woman. The Bible specifically said he talked to a Samaritan woman. A woman. The Jewish culture also did not allow men to speak to a woman especially when alone. In fact, Jews women were regarded very low. And that's why the Bible when it talks about it counted people, when Jesus said 5,000, he said 5,000 men, he didn't count the women because they were not part of the population. So in fact there's a Jews prayer which Jews man pray that I thank you Lord that you did not create me a woman a gentile or a dog according to the Jews a woman a gentile and a dog are of same category so that's how Jews despise a women so when Jesus actually address this woman. He was actually this woman. And how do you know he was small? Number one, he was going to fake water. In the Jews culture or in that culture, women used to have servants. Able to rich women would have servants and that is the work of ser. So the fact that she herself was going to fake water show showed economic status. Number two, she was not married to the Jews was actually licensed to own property. When we are not married, you don't own anything because everything belong to the man. So this woman did not have anything. So he was he was poor. The Bible talks about coming to the well at noon. That was also indicating something about her. This was the time where no one was around. No one was well drinking water. Traditionally women could drink water early in the morning or late evening but not at noon. So there was this woman was avoiding something meaning that she was lonely. This woman was lonely. This woman was rejected. This well that Jesus found him was a very distant well. She had actually passed other ways. Meaning there was something that was driving her to go very far positively because she was not accepted in the community where she she came from. So she was a rejected woman. So again it brings in the issue of a barrier. How do we reach out to these people? Another one was a spiritual barrier. When Jesus introduced the message, she was very quick to say you Jews worship in Jerusalem. We worship. We don't worship in Jerusalem. There was a religious barrier. There was a religious barrier. Another thing about this spirituality is about a lifestyle. Jesus confronted her. You are you don't have a husband and even the one that we're living with is not yours. So again revealing the sinful life that she was actually. So in this passage we see a very important lesson that barriers should not prevent us from sharing the gospel. Praise the name of the Lord. That no barrier should actually prevent you from sharing the gospel. Whether it is cultural, whether it is social, whether it is spiritual, we should not allow it to to to prevent us. Every time the first thing that you you normally encounter, somebody will tell you I am I am belong to this religion or I belong to this denomination. So by that he's telling him there is no need for you to witness to me. It doesn't matter. Maybe he attended only once or he got baptized many years ago. It doesn't matter. But the fact that he has become he has joined a certain religion that actually shield or from with from the gospel. So some people use religion as a barrier. Some use revolution. Sometimes we fear to witness to certain people. Possibly there are people high in society. Maybe they look rich, influential and powerful. And we ask ourself, do these people need the gospel? Do these people need this message? How can a young person, how a poor person, how can I be able to share the gospel to this very rich and very influential person? Or sometimes the person will be very low in society. It could be the people that have been classified as very low people in society. How can I be able to share the gospel of these people? Maybe if I start a conversation, this man will begin maybe asking for support or asking for begin to be something from me. So we normally shy away from sharing the gospel based on economic background. On Thursday we hosted the bon in my home for for lunch. My wife had started the ministry to reach out to these people. Normally they come sit there as they waiting for passengers and at one time she started a conversation and managed to convince them to come for lunch and we had a very good time with them and they confessed that many people look down upon them. Most people consider them a social conflict that they warn our children be careful of the border border people. They are not good people. So they confess that we are not treated very well in society. And many of them confess that they are not part of any church. They don't go to church on Sundays. And many of them confess also that they've got a little habits that are not very good. In fact, they say some of the work that they doing is not very beneficial because many of them ended up betting many some ended up bringing an order and we were able to reach them uh and invite them to go to whichever church that they really wanted and we were very blessed and all the response. That is an example of crossing the barriers. Crossing the barriers to reach out to other people. Some of us have workers at home. Have we actually share the gospel this year? Whether it's outside or household or some of us also are privileged to have workers in our school work. Some of us have bosses out there. Can we be able to reach out to them for the gospel or we have allowed these positions socio economic status to hinder us from crossing these boundaries. Jesus in this story is telling us we need not to allow these barriers to prevent us. Number two, it's about opportunities. The Bible says that Jesus left Judea and went to Galilee. If you can look at that map, Judea is south. Gal is up in the north. Traditionally because of the relationship between the Jews and the Gentiles, they avoided going through Samaria. In fact, they crossed over over the Jordan River to that place called Ber and then went up and then crossed the river again at the top somewhere near the Sea of Cal so that they were they could avoid going through Samaria. But on this particular day, Jesus decided to go through Samaria. Uh I did I think he did that intention because he wanted to get that message that it is important even this. Now look at what is happening here. Number one, he met this woman at the well. He met this woman at the well. A well is a common place where everybody goes. A well is not a religious place. It was not a church service. It was not a crusade. It was not one of the programs that we make. It is an ordinary place. What does this mean? God actually present opportunities in any place, even in ordinary places. Number two, it was at noon. It was at noon. A time that it was not expected. You see if it was in the morning we would assume that he knew that so many women would be coming to fake water. So he would take advantage of the numbers. Uh it could be to be accepted but it was a where no one expected again we know that the cost must be shared at any time the opportunity present itself. You don't have to wait for Sunday. You don't have to wait for the day we organize for doortodoor evangelism. We don't have to wait for people to come to church. We need to do it where we find them. It could be in the marketplace. It could be in the shop. It could be in the place of that could be righteous. It was not the plan encounter. Jesus arranged that I was going to meet this woman. This woman arrived. He knew that he was going to meet Jesus. Everybody was on this on this business. This man was coming for water. Jesus was on this journey going to to them to Gary. It was not hard. Again, we learned that doing evangelism sometimes does not require prior arrangement. God actually presents an opportunity for you and we need to use it. You know the story of the Ethiopian unac. Philip was his way and the Philip was suddenly going on his journey also and it began a coincidence that the Philip was reading the book of Isaiah and Philip was also there and he had been reading and from that he established a conversation about what he was reading and through that Philip was able to lead the children to Christ and eventually baptize him. Yes, God presents opportunities. It presents opportunities in many places. Another point is that do not underestimate the value of one one person. Jesus spend time with this one woman. It was not I don't know whether it was economical in terms of time to spend all your time and energy on this one person. But Jesus knew the importance of one. Verse 43, we see the impact of that one. Verse 43, it says after 2 days, it's not um after 2 days he left for Galilee. Now Jesus himself has appointed one Oh no, it's not verse 14. It is. Let's begin from 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's wisdom. He told me everything I did. So when Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with him and he stayed two days and because of the his words many more became believers. You see the result of investing in this one woman and investing your time and energy in this one woman later on a whole town actually came to believe in Jesus as a result of this. Jesus ignored this woman and maybe waited for an opportunity to have a big open air concert in in town or a big service somewhere that opportunity could have been lost. So Jesus saw the importance of one soul one person one person he was able to reach many because of that we've seen people you use creatively of God even in this church I remember when came here a few years ago we didn't know the potential that he He was just a lone missionary not sent by anybody without support. We didn't even know what he was doing. He even his physical appearance was not the way he is today. He was a very strong slender young man. Um so he requested that we partner with him. Um actually we after some discussion we accepted we welcomed him to be part of this congregation. We left him for training at NC fish where we supported him for 2 years after graduation. He left back to the missionary and when we you hear about um the places he has sent you heal the other day that he was in Niger. He has seen in Jan, he has seen Tanzania, very many of those countries and like right now he's talking about last year for example in Europe where doors are opening there to reach out. You can ask yourself is was it worth it investing with this person? The answer is yes. Sometimes investing in one person actually may bring a lot of results in the kingdom of God. So let's not underrate the importance of one one soul who comes to Christ. The Bible says heaven rejoices when one person repents. Praise the name of the Lord. If heaven is happy, how should we be happy when one soul repents? Next point is that it starts with a simple conversation. Sharing the gospel does not require a lot of theology. It does not require you to know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. All you need is to know how to reach out to him. First of all, let's establish a relationship. It started with water here. Please give me some water and that's how the conversation began actually portray themselves as a person who needs sometimes we need to put ourselves in that position so that we can have relationship with others. I remember a family where one day they sent the child to go and request for south Truth be here. So sometimes we actually need to show that we also need so the moment they give us then they will also free to come here. So in other words, we'll establish a relationship. Actually, Jesus was doing the same. He could have actually picked a mother for himself, but he wanted to have the conversation, the relationship with this woman. And through that, he was able to lead to this real need. By the way, we believe from health needs. Felt needs are what we go through in life. Siasa, politics, financial challenges, the weather, squeezy, squeezy, squeezing. We we need and then we go deeper to the real needs of the people which are the deep spiritual needs of these people. And that's how Jesus took this woman from literal water to the real deep need of this woman that the issue of salvation and and that is exactly what he did. He was able to lead them this person to know Jesus as Lord and Savior of this life. Many people write Bible normal things. I remember some years back when I was in the school ministry, I was ser as a chaplain in the school and we used to have morning devotion which started at 5 in the morning. Initially everybody did not know believe that it was not going to succeed because students were in number five who are praying the whole school was it wasn't something anybody was but when we started they were few but slowly the numbers increased until the whole student body were assembling by five to listen to God. So many people were shocked and I was also shocked because I didn't know I was going to succeed in this. But it was one year ago I met one of the students who was is now a man you but he was a student at that time and he he revealed the the the truth to me. He told me do you know the reason why we are coming in the morning? Why we waking up? He said it was because of the stories that you used to share. Actually it was around 207 208 and the political tension of the country was very high. So every morning I would share with them what was happening from there. So this is what has happened. This is so everybody wanted to come and hear what is this new thing that is happening. So I will share that one and then use read a portion of scripture and pray and that is that end up being a channel which I can be able to witness on the word of God. So it starts the conversation. It starts the conversation. How are you? How is your family? How are children doing? How is your business? How is this country? Some of us have football which seems to be doing well and through that you can be able to lead somebody to Christ. The the other point is that everyone can be used by God. Everyone can be used by God. We are all called to be witnesses. We are all called to be witnesses. as I've already stated will be commanded and it does not matter your social status. It does not matter your economic status or spiritual status. We are all called to be witnesses. This power woman did not meet any qualities any qualities of the servant of God. A woman who had been married five times and was in a wrong marriage. A woman who was a social med and a survivor which does not meet all the qualities of anyone who attend any message to anybody but we see the results when he took out the task and became as a a witness many people came to Christ. So I want to challenge this morning that any one of us whether you are young, you are old, you are rich, you are poor, you are a man, you are a woman, we are called to be witnesses. Praise the name of the Lord. Even the students out there, you are called to be witnesses, you are called to be witnesses of Christ in the schools where you are in your places of business. Any one of us can be used by God. There is no one who is considered unlikely. The Bible have many full of examples of people who are used by God. In the book of Kings, people of leprosy were used by God to rescue the people of his side. God even used a donkey to speak. God used a blind beggar to witness. By the way, the most influential where you reaching out to is a testimony. It's a testimony. In fact, what this woman did was only to share testimony. He went to them and said, \"You know what? I have met a man who has told me everything about myself told would this be the prophet, the Messiah?\" And people were interested because she was sharing his encounter with Jesus. Remember the story of the blind man where Jesus healed him and then he went out and the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were more happy. So one time they met this man in the crowd and they asked him, \"Are you the man who who was healed?\" He said, \"Yes.\" Do you know the man who healed you is a sinner? But the man who responded, he said, I don't know. I don't know that man. All I know is that I was blind but now I see. That is all I know. And that's a testimony. This is what happened to me. I don't know much. You don't have to know justification, glorification, sanctification. I don't know what all those complex knowledge is. All you need to know is that Jesus saves. This is the way I am. I was and this is the way I am now. This is what I've experienced and that is what it means to share the gospel. You can be you God can use anyone. God can use anyone in business. Um They can sometimes use um sales agents to go out to market a product but sometimes they use customers to market an agent to to market a product. For example, look at this situation. A sales agent comes to you and tells you this is the best speaker. This is the best in the market. You need to buy it. And then somebody from product comes to you and tells you we have used this speaker for the last 8 years and as s cannot break. The sound is wonderful. Which one are you going to buy? Which I the one that is being saved by a salesman or the one person who has used it? The person who has used it. Yes. the power of a satisfied. We can be witnesses of Christ. You don't have to be evangelist or a pastor or anybody. All you need to know is you are you you have benefited from Christ that qualifies you to be a witness. The other one is the principle of sewing and reaping. That one is found in verse 37. Jesus talked about two people. One is sewing and another one is reaping. The one who is sewing will not see the results. Sewing is somewhere the seed and forgetting about it. That is sometimes how witness is. Sometimes you only share and you don't see the response. They must make a decision or they can even plant reject now. So sometimes can be discouraging but I think this is what Jesus is saying. He's saying there is a time for sewing and there is also time for harvesting. Peter Capu the founder of A was just in this country for 3 years. He lived only for 3 years and he died. But today we have more than a million followers of NC because he planted the sick and others after the city. So don't get tired sewing the sick and witnessing because in the due time we will see the others. Finally, leading others to Christ is the most fulfilling work. Verse four, the disciples comes back. They find Jesus still in the same place. They left him and they asked him and let me read from that one. Meanwhile, his disciples acting, rabbi, eat something. But he said to them, I have food. Eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples say to each other, could someone have brought him food? Verse 34, my food, say Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent him and to finish his work. In other words, he's saying, I fulfillment and happiness by wickedness, by doing the will of God. That is what gives me joy. That is what gives me happiness. It's not the food. It is not a career. It is not the success in business. It is not the houses that I build. It is not the positions that I have. It is doing the will of God that gives me fulfillment and happiness in life. So I want to remind each one of us this morning that there is something there is a post that God has started in this world. There is a mission that God has started. And the most fulfilling thing in life is to be part of that mission. To be part of that course is the most fulfilling most fulfilling thing. Yesterday I attended a prayer day and the student tires and I saw one but I didn't have I wish to speak I would have recognized that. There is one boy who wrote pastor and I think many of you are surprised and I think if your son or a daughter comes home and tells you my career is to be a pastor you will ask for prayers. This one is now cutting a direct license to poverty and all kinds of problems. But let me tell you the other side. Doing God's work is the most fulfilling work because it is actually what God has done. It is very fulfilling to do God's work. We thank God all for the different that you have in this church. Those of you who are in will tell you how joyful it is to be in God's service to come here every week for my practice and practice all this good mission here. It keeps me All those significance processes millions of political will remain here. And I know my father. we have done something about us. So that is why we say it is why I have something more important and more. So this morning I want to please the community members are their Here I am big. Oh, it could be anybody else. It could be. It could be. Come to the end. Last question. How many of you with the I may Yes. ask us. We also keep us in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We have this great and Wow. Generation Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is the most beautiful. So we will help you again. that doesn't ask. In the name of you this morning Yeah. I pray that you give with them. Use them for the glory and honor of your name. I pray for the rest of the church that God we are not seated back but we are also here that you use us in the outfit and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. You can use us oh God. We are asking for forgiveness whatever that we have gone astray and we go even my father go now in the ministry strengthen us once again and use us for the glory and honor of your name. I pray for these three hours right now in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit we pray and believe. Amen. God bless you so much.

I want us to thank God because of the message of the delay for the message and all of us we are here so that we can serve God. I want us to pray as the choir house.

         "Abdul Rahman knew at this point that he had two choices: either meet this with hostility, anger, and maybe even violence (which would have been the short path), or venture on the long and difficult road to recovery through patience, which was the road that so many of the Prophets had tread. He chose the path of the Prophets. He gave up his prestigious medical career and easy life, and along with his wife Umm Suhaib, returned to Africa to dedicate their lives to healing the people there – physically, emotionally, mentally, but most importantly, spiritually.\nPlanting the Seeds\nIn 1980, al-Sumait started an initiative that eventually became Direct Aid. On his initiative, al-Sumait said that “ the aim was to help societies that the world has forgotten and to develop them, so we tried to develop these societies by providing education programs amongst other things ”. The organisation provided schools, healthcare centres, wells, and mosques. One of the main seeds they planted was the welfare of orphans. They would nurture these orphans from a young age with the education and support they needed, until they graduated from university, some even with postgraduate Master’s degrees.\nOne of the main things that Abdul Rahman noticed was that despite the majority of countries with Islam as their main religion having up to a 60% Muslim population, the government and ministers of these countries were mainly Christian. The reason for this was that the average Muslim child barely made it to secondary school, whilst the Christian child had help to progress through to higher education, enrol in a university outside of Africa, and return as a doctor or a politician. What was Abdul Rahman’s solution to this? He founded universities in Tanzania, Zanzibar, and Kenya.\nThe fruition of sowing these seeds became clear in a short amount of time. After al-Sumait’s death, there was a gathering of foreign ministers in Kuwait, where even the Foreign Minister of Malawi attended. He asked to be taken to the grave of al-Sumait, which he visited according to the Islamic tradition. When asked why he had chosen to come here, he answered that he was one of the orphans that had been sponsored by Abdul Rahman.\nNear enough 40 years later, Direct Aid now has 34 offices in 40 African countries.\nThe Mission of the Missionaries\nAbdul Rahman mentioned to a trusted friend of his how, in 1972 whilst he was studying in Britain, he heard of a convention that was taking place in Colorado attended by most heads of nations along with the Pope. Their agenda was Africa and how by the year 2000, the entire continent would follow Christianity. They had taken this task upon themselves and gathered a huge amount of wealth and resources in order to fulfil this mission, along with the full support of the Vatican. His friend narrated that Abdul Rahman did not expand any further into the matter or say what he intended to do – he only returned back to Kuwait.\nFor the next three decades, Abdul Rahman became a thorn in the Vatican’s side. Whilst Christian missionaries were many and took full advantage of the hunger and poverty in the region by trading bread for Christian conversion, Abdul Rahman provided for whoever was in need, regardless of colour, creed, or race. There were entire villages of Muslims who had given up their religion and accepted Christianity in exchange for food and water. Al-Sumait, on the other hand, insisted that the people learned their own languages, culture, and even songs. He did not want any political interference and remained adamant that there should be no middle man between the aid and the people. He accurately manifested the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and showcased to the world that Islam was the only real solution to any form of racism or bias. Naturally, this caused problems for Abdul Rahman, and there were at least two assassination attempts against his life. Allāh saved His servant so he could continue with this blessed work.",

If you're watching us right now, you are just a few step behind to take a decision to come into franchising um and your entrepreneurship. Um in in in today's webinar, we are happy to introduce you an electric vehicle manufacturing brand called ARD Group and RAP Eco Motors. So the RAP echo motors is a Hyderabad based professionally managed company with over 20 years of experience in the automo industry. It initially specialized in the borewell spares uh gen sets Yamaha motorcycles and agri machinery before expanding into petrol and diesel three-wheeler um manufacturing for international market. In recent years, the group has strategically diversified um into the electric vehicle manufacturing battery operated three three-wheers and that aligned with India's green mobility goal. To talk more about this, I'm joined with Mr. Pam Chabria. He is the COO with the 40 plus years of experience led diversification into EV industry, EV and international market. Um and we also have um um u Mr. Arbal Krishnan who's the former naval officer and electronics gold medalist drives EV product development and green initiative. Apart from that I'm joined with my colleagues Faison. Faison F is the key account manager. He's responsible for uh North India business expansion for this brand. We have Sarat is the business head from of Bangalore. Then we have Viml. Viml is the business head from east. So that's our team is and um you know during this webinar in case if you will have any question related to the brand or the business uh my request is to please keep on posting it into the Q&A box. If you have joined through the mobile you will get two option one is the chat and the other one is the Q&A. I mean it is it is absolutely fantastic to put all your queries into the Q&A and u we will come back with the answers once the presentation is over. Right. So let's let's get started now. I would um welcome and u you know request promoter to take the lead. Let's get started. Talk about the brands and the business opportunities that you're offering to uh the investors. Yeah. Over to you sir. Good morning and good afternoon everybody. My name is Pramot Chabria. I'm the co-founder of RAP Motors. I we have been in automo line for a long long time. Earlier we were into retail having showrooms of Yamaha, Atul Auto, Escorts, Class Harvesters, Jansets so on and so forth. About 20 years back we got into the manufacturing of three wheelers. So we have been manufacturing now three wheelers for the last 20 years. Can you put up my company profile now or somebody can put that up? Sure. We have been manufacturing the for the last 20 years and what the company that we are running was a 100% EOU. No domestic sales like I jokingly say we did a what I call a China and India we copied to Bajad machine totally and go to the photographs this is all data there's one more company profile with PP which is in PPT I prefer if that is shown so we got into three wheel manufacturing of three wheelers and we started exporting so far. So far, I can do one thing. I can send the PPT on uh WhatsApp right now. So, you can uh put that up. Okay, sir. Sure. We can do that. Yeah. Me? Yeah. I'm just sending you the P50 right now, so you can put that up. Okay. Okay. This is called Murphy's law. What you want at that time doesn't come and it is available when you are not bothered about it. Anyway, you we can I'll just put up on PPT which is not what I wanted to show to you. But something is better than nothing. You can just put the we sent you by WhatsApp just now. So we started manufacturing three wheelers and we started exporting them. We so far we have exported to about 20 countries across the world and it speaks volume that we have been competing against Baj Pio Mahendra all over TVs all over. Our biggest advantage of our product was visual acceptance as I say because it's a known fact that all over the world the best design free is bajads best design free is bajad so what we did was copied so if you have to copy try copy the best one so we copied baj and as you can see it is looking just like bajadaj but for this headlight light slightly different so that there is no copyright problem with anybody. The copyright problem does not happen at all. This is how it happened. Since we were manufacturing already manufacturing three wheelers, lot of people approached us all over and uh when electrical EV market started in India, some people approached us and wanted us to make an EV. At that time we were very happy making petrol and exporting and when we started when we decided okay we will do EV for you. We realize there are in EVs also there are there are certain categories like L3 and L5 L3 is a ricksha model that you see all over in north where it is more like a ricksha than an auto whereas ours was an auto. So what we did was we designed an specific L3. If you go go up a little, you'll find the picture also. You can see in the second slide which looks like a bajach old model bajach. This we made as an L3 model which was you know something for a customer or for anybody. The most important thing in life is promotion. Nobody wants a demotion. Everybody wants a promotion. So all the pedal richa people all over north happily went on to irrias but in south where pedal rickshas did were not existing uh people did not want to buy an Ishia because a drive auto driver doesn't want to drive a ricksha you want to drive an auto so we designed this L3 model which looks like an auto but is it passes the e-ria category what we say L3 I'll tell you people the difference between L3 L3 and L5 is not very big. In L3 the machine width cannot be more than 1 m. L5 is the normal auto that you see on roads. At that point of time the L5 specifications were not available with AI and IAT for approvals. So we have designed this picture what you are seeing this an L3 model which comes under the EIA category where the width is less is 1 m and the speed is not more than 25 30 kilometers. So this we have been selling in the south not acceptance even for the ricksha fellow as I said promotion is the root cause for everything. A rsha fellow will happily buy an L3 auto who which brand is Rani we call it Rani and he will not feel demoted. So this caught up everywhere but the market now is shifting towards L5. If you go to the next slide, you can see the L5 machine. What you have seen in the first slide also. This is the L5 machine which looks like a absolute baj auto. Other than the small lights we have exported to all the countries that you are seeing in that slide. UK, Japan, Nigeria, Ethopia, Egypt, Bellis, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Peru, Bles. So these are the countries we have exported already exported our they all these places were exporting our petrol models when we were running an EOU. We have sent EVs to Liberia, Tanzania, it good good amount of enquies are there but in exports where three wheelers as I said is the cheapest mode of commercial transport the most acceptable machine as a commercial machine for people's earnings but in which is very popular in Africa but the problem in Africa is there is no there is not enough power 24 hours to charge the batteries. So now I come to my product L3. I've already told you it is very popular all over not because it looks like an auto. It looks like auto doesn't look like a Yeah, hold this slide there my dear friend. We have got cargo models. We have got delivery vans and we have driveaway chi. This is all L3. What your pictures you are seeing is L3 and same can be got in L5 also here what happens people like you see lot of foots so drive away chi anything can be built all e-commerce companies want a delivery vans and e- loader is standard machines everybody uses so L3 is very popular but the future because of the slow speed government is not allowing them on the main roads and big cities big cities and on the main roads also they are all proposing L5. The machines that you see of Bajage, Mahindra, Pajio, PVS are all L5 models and they are our competition because all reputed companies are manufacturing products on 48 volts and so is our machine on 48 volts and we are giving an option of various op for for sale as a sales tool. We are giving lot of options where the customer can I mean uh before I go there let me make a few things. Our biggest advantage for our L5 product I will speak about the advantage of L5 product before I go into sales tools and all the biggest advantage of our L5 product is it is ripped all the spare part are interchangeable bajors. So every nook and corner India or for that matter world there are spare parts available there are mechanic available mechanics available because for an auto there should be zero downtime the the driver is a poor fellow he if he stops the machine he loses money so we have made sure that all components are same as bad so there is no problem with the spare parts or service and most important our machine is 100% Indian we have got nothing Chinese all other companies some companies I'm talking about the smaller companies major companies are anyway doing Indian so we are on par with them in quality and for quality I can tell you that since we have been competing against the major brands all over the world I mean that itself speaks volumes because we could compete with them because we were giving quality if you are not better than them, you're on par with them because end en\r\n",

         "95,62,72,82... BREAKING: Traoré & Erdoğan sign $5.2B Ankara deal; target 1.2M jobs across the Sahel\nSeptember 16, 2025 — In Ankara, Captain Ibrahim Traoré and President Erdoğan announced a $5.2B Ankara deal aimed at building a Turkey–Sahel industrial corridor $5.2B across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The agreement outlines rail/highway links, factories, and renewables with a Traoré–Erdoğan deal 1.2M jobs projection, shifting the Sahel from aid to industry. We break down the pillars (infrastructure, energy, industry, education), financing structure (including Islamic finance Musharaka Murabaha components), and what this means for regional power, trade routes, and sovereignty.

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nankara signs big s5.2b with traore\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:history. In the heart of Anchora, Ibrahim Trouore of Burkina Faso and Reab Taib Erdogan of Turkey signed a deal worth 5.2 billion. Not a loan dressed as charity, not an IMF package tied to gold or uranium, but a partnership agreement promising to generate 1.2 million jobs and establish what could become the largest industrial corridor in Africa. The announcement reverberated instantly, shaking both allies and critics alike. For decades, Africa has been offered development through contracts written in Washington, Paris, and London. Contracts that often left the continent poorer than before. But this moment felt different. Turkey, itself, a nation that straddles East and West, now emerges as a principal partner in Africa's bold new experiment. Factories, transport hubs, and trade corridors, not aid handouts, form the pillars of this agreement. Could this be the model of cooperation Africa has been waiting for? The numbers alone command attention. A $5.2 billion injection equals nearly 2.5% of Burkina Faso's entire GDP. The promise of 1.2 million jobs could reduce unemployment across the Sahel by double digits. Compare that to traditional aid packages measured in millions, not billions, that often evaporate into bureaucracy. And yet, beyond numbers lies symbolism. For the first time, an African leader is turning away from debt relief schemes and toward an industrial partnership rooted in production and sovereignty. Is this not the truest definition of independence? Predictably, the West reacted with unease. Commentators in London warned of geopolitical risks. Analysts in Washington described the deal as a strategic realignment. But on the streets of Wuagadugu, Bamako, and Name, the reaction was one of pride. Citizens saw not just a contract, but a statement that Africa's resources and labor can fuel African industries, not merely foreign stock markets. Could this be the moment the narrative shifts from Africa as deter to Africa as architect of its own destiny? The deal between Troure and Erdogan is more than numbers on paper. It is a challenge to old systems, a declaration that partnerships can be forged without chains and a warning that the global balance of power is shifting. But what does this mean for the wider world from Wall Street to Beijing? The $5.2 billion deal signed in Anchora is not just about railways, factories, or jobs. It is a political statement, loud, clear, and impossible to ignore. For the first time in decades, an African alliance has turned eastward, not to Moscow or Beijing, but to Ankora. Turkey, a NATO member, yet often at odds with Western capitals, has positioned itself as a bridge between continents. By investing in Africa's industrial corridor, Anchora signals its readiness to play a new role in the emerging multipolar world order. Could this be the opening chapter of Turkey as Africa's strategic partner? The implications are global. In Washington, analysts worry about losing influence in a region long treated as an aid dependent zone. In Brussels, concerns grow that Turkish African corridors could redirect trade flows worth billions of US dollars annually, bypassing European ports. Meanwhile, Beijing watches with caution, knowing that Ankara's bold move may complicate its own belt and road ambitions. If Africa can now choose between Washington, Beijing, and Ankara, does this not redefine the very map of global power? This agreement is more than economics. It is a symbol that Africa is no longer the silent subject of others strategies. It is becoming the stage where a new balance of power is rehearsed. But what exactly lies inside this deal that makes it so disruptive. The ink on the Ankora agreement was barely dry when its details began to circulate and they revealed not a loan trap, not a donation wrapped in conditions, but a blueprint for transformation. Unlike IMF contracts that mortgage natural resources, this deal was built on investment, infrastructure, and technology. It was a packact that spoke not of dependency, but of building capacity. At the heart of the agreement lies infrastructure. With a commitment of $2.8 8 billion. Turkey pledged to finance and construct highways linking Uaga Dugu, Bamako, and Name, a new regional railway system capable of moving both goods and people across borders and modern airports to open new corridors of trade. For the Sahel Alliance, long strangled by poor logistics. This was not just concrete and steel. It was freedom of movement. Could sovereignty truly exist without the power to move goods across one's own land? The second pillar is industry, backed by $1.4 $4 billion. Textile factories, agroprocessing hubs, and technology parks will be built aimed at keeping value added production inside Africa rather than exporting raw materials for pennies. For decades, cocoa from Ghana, cotton from Burkina Faso, and uranium from Niger have been shipped abroad, generating trillions in global markets while local farmers remained poor. This deal reverses the equation. Factories on African soil, jobs for African hands, and products stamped made in the Sahel. Is this not the essence of self-reliance? Energy forms the third pillar. With $800 million allocated, the deal prioritizes renewable power plants, solar grids, and crossber transmission lines. In a region where nearly 50% of the population still lacks access to electricity, this is more than infrastructure. It is justice. Energy is the bloodstream of modern economies and with it comes light for schools, power for hospitals, and fuel for industry. If Africa controls its own power, who can control Africa? Finally, health and education anchor the agreement. Though smaller in financial scale, $200 million, this investment may prove the most lasting. New hospitals, universities, and vocational training centers will rise, coupled with scholarships and teacher exchanges. Technology transfer is not just about machines. It is about minds. By insisting on knowledge transfer, Troué ensured that the deal was not a one-time transaction, but the seed of long-term independence. Can a continent that educates its own engineers and doctors ever again be told it is poor? Every clause of the Anara agreement reflects a philosophy, partnership instead of patronage, and every number tells a story. Billions invested not in resource extraction, but in roads, factories, grids, and schools. For the first time, Africa sees a contract that builds rather than bleeds. But the question remains, will these promises survive the test of implementation, or will they be met with the same resistance from global powers that fear a sovereign industrial Africa? Numbers tell a story, and here they speak louder than speeches. The Turkey Sahel agreement is set to generate 480,000 direct jobs and another 720,000 indirect jobs, reshaping the labor landscape of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. That is over 1.2 million livelihoods, a figure that dwarfs traditional aid projects, which rarely create more than a few thousand positions. For a region where youth unemployment has hovered around 30%, these jobs are not statistics. They are lifelines. Could this be the first time foreign investment empowers Africa's workers instead of exploiting them? Beyond jobs lies training, the cornerstone of true sovereignty, the deal includes programs to train 150,000 workers in technology and industry, from engineers in renewable energy to technicians in agrop processing. Even more groundbreaking, 25,000 management positions will be reserved for African professionals, ensuring that factories and projects are not just built in Africa, but run by Africans. This detail alone marks a radical departure from past contracts where decision-making often stayed in foreign hands. Is this not the definition of partnership rather than dependency? By combining employment with education, the agreement turns raw labor into skilled human capital, Africa's most undervalued resource. But the question lingers, how will this massive workforce reshape the Sahel's political and economic future? What makes Turkey different? Why did the Sahel Alliance trust Ankara when it has rejected contracts from Paris, Washington, and even Beijing? The answer lies in history, culture, and strategy. Unlike European powers, Turkey has no colonial past in Africa. There are no memories of resource plunder under a Turkish flag, no scars of forced treaties, no monuments to exploitation. This absence is not a weakness. It is Anchora's greatest advantage. In a continent where memory shapes politics, trust begins, where past wounds do not exist. Could this be why Anchora's arrival feels less like intrusion and more like partnership? Second, the bond of faith and culture runs deep in Mali, Niger, and Bkina Faso, nations where Islam is central to daily life. Turkey presents itself not as a foreign overseer, but as a fellow traveler. Shared traditions, familiar values, and religious solidarity, transform business deals into something more profound. Cooperation anchored in cultural respect. How often in Africa's dealings with the West has respect truly been part of the equation? Third, Turkeykey's technology and industry stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the West. From drones to construction, from textiles to renewable energy, Anchora has proven it can deliver cutting edge solutions without demanding political submission. A $5.2 billion package with built-in technology transfer signals, something the IMF never offered. Not just capital, but capability. When machines, factories, and skills remain in African hands, does that not redefine the meaning of independence? Finally, there is the principle of win-win. The Anchora deal does not mortgage gold or oil. It does not demand austerity or privatization. Instead, it channels billions into highways, factories, grids, and schools, projects that benefit both sides. Turkey gains markets and influence. Africa gains jobs, infrastructure, and dignity. This balance rare\r\n",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Israel adm [Music] [Music] le here. Oh Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Praise be the name of his glorious sovereignty forever and ever. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them thoroughly to your children. And you shall speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them for a sign upon your hand. And they shall be for a reminder between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and upon your gates. When the word entered the world, freedom entered it. Torah exists only to establish peace. And its highest teaching is love and kindness. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and what is not to and that is the whole Torah. Go learn it. Honoring one another, doing acts of kindness, and making peace. These are our highest duties. is equal to them. So let us learn in order to teach. Let us learn in order to do. She is a tree of life to those who hold fast. All who cling to her find happiness. Her ways are ways of pleasantness. And all her paths are peace. Help us to return to you Lord. Then truly shall we return. Renew the days of our first love. Amen. Together. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Let us not enter into testing, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. Vicki Shekarta Rabba. Thankful is what I am before your face. Okay. Living and eternal for restoring my soul within me with compassion. Great is your faithfulness. Turn to someone and say Shabbat shalom. And have a seat and we'll get started. I've got just a real uh quick few announcements. Uh one of them remember every Tuesday uh we have prayer time at 1. On Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:30 we have mana time for seniors. Uh of course we've had a roshana service. We're still having our yomapor service and our soot service right here uh starting next Wednesday night. Uh, as you know, the year has now begun and our new calendar that has both audio and video built in through QR codes. It's good all the way to 2027 is now available. Uh, the America at War Book is available at half price. And then lastly, I want everyone to know about our Jordan Saudi Arabia tour next year in 2026. Now, I think I've got my volume up. I hope. Here we go. Uh, here are some people. I got some videos of them celebrating Roaches Shana. Here it is up in Alaska. That's Paul and Donna Claus in company. That's a long breath. And then here we have in Kenya, this is in Nairobi, Kenya. I don't know why the video went out, but [Music] can we celebrate the Lord for the Amen. Okay, now look at this. This well is completed at the Jerusalem church. All right. And Jill, I'm not sure if you have Francis's uh Yeah, we got it. USB ready. Come on up, Francis. We have Francis here all the way from Kenya. Yay. Woohoo. Give us an update on what is going on in Kenya. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. Thank you, daddy. Yes. Uh yeah, this is the day that the Lord has made and we have we will rejoice in it. Yeah, this is uh our partnership with Elsadai Ministries here in the US. And today I'm standing here to appreciate and uh uh speak a blessing from all I bring all the greetings from Kenya. Yay. Not only Kenya but from Masai Mara. You see um this everything began here when uh Papa Mark and Bill came to our village and this is where they stayed. This is our village. This is our home and you see we are standing in a in a mountain and it was I just it started when I went to Israel and this uh church sponsored me through El Shadai Ministries to go to Israel. So my trip to Israel was a blessing to us and uh so before that uh this is where we we used to draw water. This is a small pond and we take water from here to and clean it like doing um putting some chlorine on it and after that we put into small buckets and drink. So here this is the water we uh that's the drinking water. That's the drinking water. So we drink this water always. This is in my compound. This is what we used. Our donkeys get inside there. our cows, our dogs, everything. They anyone with a quench when you want to quench your thirst, you just go there, drink, take the cup, take it. But guess what? When Pastor M came and see this and say, \"Lord, it's an incense, we're going to do something.\" So we started from there. So this is the the well that started just beside the small pond you saw and this is the tongue now 20,000 liters up it's already changed a place is so changed so let's go to the next point yeah this is the team this is the church that I I pastor here uh we have um Nashai is our sister from Canada and Papa and uh and me and Bill. So this is the church that they teach. This is the second teaching area when uh then uh from here we went to Jerusalem church which you saw there are this is a this is the Jerusalem church. the the Jerusalem church looks like that and that is a village where uh pastor Mark taught about the Torah. So and we thank God for for you all. Let's go to the next point. The project started from there. This is a distribution of our Bibles and all these kids are preparing for form four. They are going the last year at the high school to go to the to prepare themselves to the university. So it was a team of 100 students and we give everyone a Bible. So, so from uh three of our churches, these students uh I started with them since they were kids and now they are over 18. So, they are running to the next level. So, we started here and that's why they have uh a vision. they written in their t-shirts. We have a vision to take the Torah to nations and inside this I'm training about uh 20 20 missionaries. You have identified places like uh Ethiopia, Northern Kenya, Tanzania. I started training them from low. So I really thank God that we can uh teach them and we are praying that God is going to change for the last 21 years that I've been pastoring across this small region. I want to change the hearts and raise missionaries for the next generation. So these are the children the young girls that I saved them from uh FGM uh the Masai people they have they still have that such kind but now it's a bit silent the they do female general modulation but I saved them and over 80 of them are going to universities high school and that is a celebration then the parents came following them so the parent receive a Bible and the child receive a Bible and they gave me a blanket. Yeah. So they bring that's what they can they can give me. So they they did that. Let's go to the next level. Yeah. This is Jerusalem church. Jerusalem church. It's like you can see over 20 to to 30 kilometers away. And people here they have no water. the there's a small stream that they dig so that when the water flows in the in the river. Thank you my brother Max. And uh so the flowing river will have some little ponds. In every stop there is a pond. In every stop there is a pond. So that's when the the place is dry no rain they go to little ponds. And when Elshadai Ministries president came to our village, it changed everything. There is uh another 10,000 liter tank on top and the the the well is done finished. They started drinking water. This mind-blowing like the the man here we call him Abraham in the Jerusalem church. This old man had four wives and of um 20some children. He said, \"I don't need land for the children for the people to go to church because her uh one of her daughters got sick and the hand had a problem and I prayed and she got healed totally.\" So that is how we got this land. So we got a land and now we have a church on it. Yeah. So and the field is very fertile for this world. We will start training what I saw in Israel about agriculture. This is what we going to do for sustainability and people to have to know how to to do to harvest and uh so that our water will be productive beside drinking and uh and washing clothes and everything else. We're going to teach. We're going to welcome anyone with the skills of of agriculture, horiculture, all that we can teach because we have 80,000 liters per 10 hours. So 8,000 liters per hour. So every 10 hours which the solar because we have a solar, we don't have the the electricity running. So we have we use the solar. So these people here and everyone who has given to this we have a solar. So no day that we can say it has stopped because of paying or anything the solar is up. So everything is running. So when we have this we will go forward. Yeah. So next picture please. Yeah. Uh this lady is the single Messiah lady which I pray we prayed for at the GPS. God did you see that? And uh she's working with the prison. We worked with her for 8 years um reaching prisons and in this prison this is the first time she came to the area and this is interesting. No single Masai lady is in prison. Only 1% in the whole country in Kenya and Tanzania. They have done a research and there is almost zero crimes in in the area where the Masai lives. Yeah. There's no police. There are no police. There's no crime. It's like zero. So that's why the conservations, the animals and all that. We appreciate God or uh also for our fathers like they put everything in place because um learning Torah it's like we have a justice system very working very nicely and we have um a conflict resolution system which is done by elders, women or moran or young people. So they have a level. If you do something beyond the level of elders, then they can just hunt you to the police and that's it. But if you your crime slowly slowly they have the chiefs and other people they have a very nice justice system and um I've been in that um part doing that resolution. If someone has done something which we can solve it. Yeah. By crimes that which are not so bad. So we do that. So these people uh I went here preaching the gospel and also distributing Bibles from here. This lady was went to find people to to help on sanitary sanitary towels, toilet papers because you see the children their their mothers are in prison but the children they cannot separate. So they can the children stay in prison. They stay too in prison. So they have a single uh a way of taking children to land somewhere. But their mothers are been convicted. Some has a serious crime, big ones. But the child is not excluded because so they are almost like everything. So they are churches who partner to give milk uh learning materials, pencils or pens and we give them. So I've been doing this even before. So reaching them, praying for them and teaching uh the gospel and I got an opportunity uh when uh this church came the president under director everyone when they visited we went to a place and I found something to bring to them. Guess what? I found a lady here that she was conficted for 5 years. What happened? I said everyone to say his prayer prayer request and the lady said this is we have a water problem in this prison and I have only three months to leave and everyone was saying oh pray for my case to end pray for every any other problem. I want to see my people. I want to see my parents. I want to see my mother. I want to see my father. I want to see this. I left my car home. You know these people. But one single person said it's a problem because they they go to the river to draw water. All the guards and the prisoners, the inmates. But yeah, the guards are not excluded. They go all to the water and they take bath. Pastor Mark was there. We went to the river across the road and a lady from Canada just bathed in the river because we didn't have bathrooms. So he just like did that and this is what they do. So and when I shared the picture with pastor Mark he said tell them that prayer is answered. This prison was started as a concentration camp in 1952 50. In 1952 it became a prison and up to now they don't have a single well. They go to a Mara river draw water and bring it in buckets every two days. So now we have a well. Let me jump in there a second. What's amazing that lady, she gets out in three months from the jail. Yeah. Her prayer was that the prison would get a well even though she won't be helped by it, but that was her goal. And now we have a prison with a well. Yeah. And through this, the Kenyan government through the permanent secretary of the prisons all of Kenya signed a letter for me to to do uh prison ministry. So when papa you come, we go to the biggest prison in Kenya. The big Yeah. So just because we put the well at the prison, the government has given us free access to every prison. I mean that's just yeah they don't they they uh they they really the government don't allow any picture to be taken through the prisons but because of wellw wishes we use this for what we are doing today. So many people are happy for that. Okay, let's see. Go to the next one. Yeah. Uhhuh. This is Yes. This is a the prison god. Yeah. The prison god and this is the leader and our the lady is leading the other side. Yeah. Oh. Ah. This Yeah. This is the well. This is it the day. So, we're really happy. This guy is the one who did the geological survey. And this is the day you see this uh man is uh the prison chaplain. Yeah, the prison chaplain. But every person is trained. They don't allow any civilian to preach there. But I found an opportunity. I don't have any training military history. But I do I do the best. Yeah. And this is what happened. 400 people 450. We had only 50 people who are Christians. But by the end of this sermon, all the 400 were crying. 400. Glory to God. Let's go to the next one. Next slide. Yeah. The I think that Yes. Oh my goodness. You Oh, this one. You can't miss this. I met this old man three years ago and two of his sons died because one died through a bullet and the other one died through um an elephant hit. And this old village, they live in northern Kenya. So that's Muslim area. Yeah, this is Muslim area and it's the only village without a mosque. Yeah, these are these are Masai speaking people in northern Kenya. So they they are and they are exploited. They are almost assimulated by Muslims. That's this is those homes I showed you with the wood sticks and clothes over it. Yes. That's the people that live up there. Yes, that is the people live up there. So, we we will we will we are praying I've been praying for the last two years about this after corona. I visited there and now we are praying that we they can get water for this village because this is the only thing they have abandoned two abandoned schools and uh I went there. There is um some photos for the school which is closed there. The government is giving them teachers uh but books, pencils and bros they don't they don't buy for them. The parents should buy and here nothing growing. Cows go very far because they are pastoralist and we are praying for this village. They were really desperate. That is how they live. Yeah. I lived in this homes some years back but now the Masai there are still Masai people who live like this but this one is so much Yeah. This is next slide. Yeah. Next one. Next slide. Yeah. Mhm. This is uh our suahili bibles in Korea which we gave in the in Tanzania Tanzanian border. Tanzanian border. The pastor that we are working with is a teacher. So he's uh he's he's is working with the children with the government. So to me I have more I'm I'm free. I'm a missionary. So I don't have nothing to to wait. Where they say go, I go and they come, I come. Yeah. Yes. I am in the through the this church. Now I am in the Bible society. This is the director and they are using my picture in the Bible society for the Masai Bibles. They so they are using my picture because now we bought over 2,000 which is not which is it's not a simple thing to buy such a great This is a Masai village. We went to see the Morans. The Morans are like a kind of protection for the Masai people. It's a process. It's an initiative process which they go before they do the initiation they go for Moran. After the initiation they become morans and they they experience and learn about Masai people. So and through this we went to the Amanata. These are homes with this small sticks. I I wish for home. Yeah these are homes. This is where they live. The children here they they are nursing children. So they are their mothers are here. Their fathers are here and we are here. and they didn't allow to preach the gospel because it's it's it's a total different uh culture but through uh God's grace I had an opportunity to do that. You see these are houses like the same one but in the other area it's very dry. So going to let's go do Yes. So we took water with a tank with a tractor. So this is what we did. Sugar, water, and Bibles same day. Thank you. Go ahead. Yeah. These are people who are appreciating about the Bibles. They were really crying cuz this is another You guys are the ones that got them the Bibles. Yeah. Thank you, Lord. Yeah. And everyone was happy. You see all bucket this guy. You remember? Oh, I remember that. You remember this? Oh, I sure do. Yeah. Okay. Yes. This church, they received their Bibles in the village uh where Mark visited and us. So, this is a big huge ceremony. Then they all received their Bibles. Is that amazing? Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you all for such a blessing. This is uh the pence in the village in in the northern village. So we thank God for that. Thank you very much for your prayers and support. Thank you daddy. I appreciate everything. That's why yeah for the last 15 years I've been waiting for a day like this since I knew Mark back in those years. Yeah. in uh back 2010 up to date and one single visit has changed my life and my village. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Go ahead. You go ahead. Uh what a blessing to have him here uh with us. Let's see. All right. Now, one thing I wanted to mention before we set up and worship. How many of you have ever heard of the Tower of Babel? Okay. If you remember what that was, uh this was after the flood. And this is mankind's uh response to God. It's like, you want to go to war, God? Let's go to war, you know. Well, as many of you know, Tower of Babel represents all the nations coming together against God. Well, this last week here we have the uh European Union recognizing the state of Palestine and it's like they're raising their fist. But here this last week of course we have or the last few weeks we've had the total uh lunar eclipse. We've had the solar eclipse and I believe this is God is saying he's about to bring his fist down uh on the rest of the world that are want to divide his land. What I think it's fascinating is many of you have heard of the ring of fire that goes all the way around the Pacific uh ocean. For the first time in history, this last July saw the largest number of earthquakes over the magnitude of seven in a single month. In just this last July, there was a 7.3, 7.4, 7.0, and an 8.8. All in July. The next month was the month of Alul with the lunar eclipse. The next month was Tishry with the solar eclipse. Well, what do we see in August? There was a 7.5. In September, a 7.4. September 18th, the 7.8. And what does the Lord do in the middle of all of that? He brings in the uh lunar eclipse, the solar eclipse. And so, and right in the middle of that, God trying to speak to the nations. We have a tower babble response with the EU. putting their fist up saying, \"We're going to divide your land. We are in charge, not you.\" See, God is the one who created all the borders for all the nations. It says, \"All right. Well, now the EU says the UN and we get to determine where borders are.\" So, this is a real in-your-face thing to God. Well, what is fascinating is when you get on God's time schedule, I'll have you know right now we time wise every row represents seven years. There's one year, two years, three, four, five, well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is called a schmita week. Seven years. All right? And there's seven going down. But I want you to notice here we are. Uh now this was in uh yeah 2013 2016 tower of babel being uh built toward the end of the first cycle well of a jubilee year. I think it's fascinating. Here's where Abraham receives the promise on Passover. But it was right here when Abraham exits Babylon and he comes to the promised land right here. He but then he goes down to Egypt, returns to Canaan, separates from Lot. Lot's captured, encounters Mechisedc, and then it's right here. He receives uh the promise on Passover, and it was a schmita year. So, the Schmidita years are very important. We're going to take a look at that more later. Uh but we also have our Genesis book with the 5-hour Hebrew audio download. It comes along with it. We also have our gospel book uh that is now available. And we have our uh part two from Acts to Revelation. Should be here in about 6 weeks. And right here is what it looks like inside. Here we have not only the Gospels, but the rest of the New Testament coming in Hebrew with the transliteration. With that said, let's stand. Had a long announcements this time, but hey, what can I say? We enjoyed having Francis with us. Amen. All right. Lord Ainu Moanu, our father, our king. We just thank you so much for everything you're doing in each one of our lives. And right now, Lord, I just pray that you would give every single one of us eyes to see, ears to hear, and a heart to understand in Yeshua's name. Amen.

We worship you with all creation. I sing praise. You are my everything and I will adore you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a clap offering. Woohoo. Thank you. You may be seated. the uh Facebook part. Uh for some reason, this is the second week in a row we've had a problem with Facebook, but we have people on YouTube that are watching and of course on our live stream, but right now we have people watching from all 50 states including Canada, India, Netherlands, Australia, the UK, the Virgin Islands, Kenya, Nigeria, Cayman Islands, all over. Yay. Well, so excited. Okay, today the Torah portion is vi which means and he went. This is referring to our uh opening verse here in Deuteronomy 31:1. And Moses went and he's speaking to all of Israel. And look what he said. Today's my birthday. And he is 120 years old. So it's a happy birthday. And for Moses that was on the seventh day of the month of Adar. And in Deuteronomy 31 6-8 he's telling all of Israel to be strong and of a good courage. Don't fear. Don't be afraid because they're about to go in and take the promised land. Too many people walk in a spirit of fear. Yes. I'm serious. They just walk in a spirit of fear. What in the world are you afraid of? You know, I tell you what, this this life is a vapor. It's a wind. It passes away. If you don't believe in an afterlife, oh my gosh, I would be full of fear. But if you realize dying is just changing clothes, that's all it is, you know. And I am not here for this world anyway. I'm passing through. And so for me, uh, my I don't want to say the greatest fear is not getting the mission done God's called me to do. Before I go, I say, God, don't take me out till I've at least accomplished what you've want me to accomplish. And but then he says, God will not fail you. He won't forsake you. And then Moses calls Joshua and says in front of everybody, be strong and of a good courage. Okay? God's going to go with you into this promised land. And he says, \"God is not going to fail you. He's not going to forsake you. So don't be afraid.\" Now, here's what's amazing. Look at Deuteronomy 3:19. Moses wrote the Torah. He delivered it to the priests that bore the ark of the covenant. And he puts this book into the Ark of the Covenant. Now, look at Deuteronomy 17:15. I'm going to jump back a few chapters. Moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years, you hear that? At the end of every seven years, in a year of release, okay, what is that called? Schmita year. It's a schmita week, which means a week of seven years. And the seventh year is the Schmita year. And so God says at the end of every seven years in the year of release, but look at what day it is to be done on. What day does it say? You guys know English. It's on your notes. Okay. Feast of tabernacles. What day do you proclaim the year of Jubilee? I mean, what day? What day do you proclaim the year of Jubilee? Yamapore. So Yom Kapor every 50 years on Yomkapor you declare the year of jubilee but every seven years you proclaim the year of liberty on the feast of tabernacle. So yum kapor is jubilee tabernacles is every seventh year. That's going to be important to remember and you'll see why in a minute. Okay let's see. Oh, I skipped Deuteronomy 17:15. Look at this. God says, \"When you come into the land the Lord your God has given you, you possess it. You dwell in it, and you're going to say, I want a king like all the nations.\" God says, \"You shall surely set a king over you, but it has to be the one that God chooses. From one among your brethren, you shall set as king. You may not set a foreigner who is not your brother.\" So, what does that mean? They can't have a Hittite be the king of Israel. They can't have an Ammonite, a Moabitete, an Edomite. Okay, got that? I mean, that would make sense, you would think. Okay, now look at this. In Deuteronomy 31:10-12, it says it has to be done in the seventh year on the Feast of Tabernacles and the place God chooses, which is Jerusalem. you have to read this Torah before all of Israel in their hearing. Now, that's not the entire five books, but there was sections that they had to read, which was very important, and you will see why. It says, \"You have to read it before all of Israel in their hearing, gather everyone together, the men, the women, the children, your stranger.\" Who would have the authority to do that? The king. No one else has the authority to tell everyone you drop what you're doing and you come here right now on this day and we're going to read this. Okay. And so that is called does anyone know that what that's called every seven years when the king comes together and says everybody to come. It's called the hakeel. Hakl. That's what it means. everyone comes together and then the king would stand up and he would read certain sections of the Torah. Well, look at this. Jeremiah is like 500 years later. Well, a thousand years from Moses, 500 years from David. And look what it says in Jeremiah 34:13-15. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought him out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And now he's quoting what we just read in Deuteronomy. He says at the end of seven years, every man has to set free his Hebrew brother who's been sold. When he serves six, you're to let him go free. But look at this. Your fathers never did obey me. And now you recently turned and did what...",

If you have your Bibles, please turn with me to the book of John, the Gospel of John, chapter 4. We're going to read a very long pass portion of scripture today. So, I will not ask you to start because you get tired. In our home, we normally read through the Bible and we normally do rotation. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. N. Others have done the hard work and you have the benefits of their labor. Verse 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony. He told me everything I ever needed. So when Samitas came to him, they asked him to stay with them and he stayed 2 days and because of these words maybe more believers. They say to the woman, we no longer believe just because of what you said. Now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world. Our God and our father, we thank you because of this message that you have prepared us for us today. As I deliver this message, I pray for clarity. Oh, I pray for courage. I pray for confidence. I pray for your inspiration that you may use me. I also pray for the listeners this morning that God you may open their hearts that they may receive this message. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. I will title the message this morning spreading the gospel. Spreading the gospel. It is one of the neglected ministries in the church today. It is one of the ministries that is not emphasized today. I'm asking when did you last share the gospel to anyone in the past few years? I don't want you to raise your hands but ask yourself why did you share the gospel? Why did you ask somebody to receive Jesus? Those of us sitting here this morning, have you led anyone to Christ? Have you led anyone to Christ? If you are sincere enough, I think very many few months would go up because if that was the case, we would not have a room for the people in churches today. So it's true that it's not it's a ministry that has been even me I don't remember the last time I spoke about witnessing to sharing the gospel the last year when we were about to open the church we organized for doortodoor evangelism and open air crusade and actually it became an eye opener to us. We realized how he equipped our people are to do the right to witness. Majority of the banks that we moved around were actual visitors but our old members were perishing. So it is indicating that that area is lacking. We have so many departments in this church. We have the praise and worship. who have just led us in a wonderful session of worship. We have the choir, we have the usher who are doing a wonderful job there. We have the security, we have the project department, we have the missions. But it's unfortunate that we don't have a strong and vibrant outreach empowerment in our church. How we hope to grow if we don't reach out to our community. How we hope to fulfill the great commission if we don't share the gospel. Sharing the gospel is a command. We are not commanded to seek. We are not commanded to do all these other mysteries. But when Jesus actually finished his work on earth, he left one command to the disciples. He told them, \"Go preach the good news to the whole world.\" That is a command that we've given. We call it the great commission. But some people have said this is the great omission. We have omitted the great work that God has called us. So this morning using the story that we have read our challenge each one of us to take up this great mission that God has given us to share the good news. In this very long text, Apostle John actually did it deliberately. This is the longest conversation that Jesus had with anybody. He did not even have a long conversation with disciples the way he did to this woman. And the writer of this text decided to record it. However long it is, he recorded it because it is very important. It is very important. Number two, the position of this story is also very important. It was after chapter 3. In chapter 3 of the book of John, there is another conversation. This time it was conversation with Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a Jews religious leader, a very friendship and a very rich man. The Bible say he came to Jesus at night and had a conversation with him about issues with eternal life. And then chapter four another conversation with a nameless we are not given the name of this American woman. We are not told but by the description she was a noble. So we are coming from a very influential leader to a noble which is an indication that John wanted to let us know that Jesus is concerned about all of them. He's concerned about the rich intellectual the religious leaders just the way he's concerned with the people who are nobodyies in society. And the last part which this text is important is it addresses the fundamental truth of the scripture that Jesus came to seek and to save the lost soul that is his mission. So out of this text we can know those three parts. Now as we go through this story that's why I deliberately read the whole text because there are so many lessons that we can learn about reaching out. And today I'm going to take you through very quickly on six lessons that we can learn from this. Something that we can learn about reaching out to those who are reaching out to the gospel. The first thing that we see here is about barriers. Barriers in the gospel. We see this in verse 9. Verse 9 um says the Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a king. I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a dream?\" These were two people who are already facing some barrier and there are about three barriers here. Number one, there is a cultural barrier. The Jews and the Samaritans had different cultures and it emanated from what happened in 722 BC when the nation of Israel was taken into captivity. All the young men, women, ablebodied people were taken captiv captivity. The land was left almost empty. Very old and sick and people could not go the distance were left behind. Now the empty land was later occupied by foreigners who came to settle and they intermarried with the remnants the people who were made and as a result a new group of people emerged. People were not fully Jews and they were not fully Gentiles. They had a little element of Jews culture and a little element of Jews of Gentile culture. So when the other two years back they found this corrupted corrupted culture corrupted religion and there is a rift that developed between these two. So they could not agree and therefore gentile not gentiles but Samaritans and Jews were not relating in any way. So when Jesus talked to this woman she was surprised. You are a Jew. How how can you do this? How can you speak to me? You are you are of a different culture. Number two is that this was a woman. The Bible specifically said he talked to a Samaritan woman. A woman. The Jewish culture also did not allow men to speak to a woman especially when alone. In fact, Jews women were regarded very low. And that's why the Bible when it talks about it counted people, when Jesus said 5,000, he said 5,000 men, he didn't count the women because they were not part of the population. So in fact there's a Jews prayer which Jews man pray that I thank you Lord that you did not create me a woman a gentile or a dog according to the Jews a woman a gentile and a dog are of same category so that's how Jews despise a women so when Jesus actually address this woman. He was actually this woman. And how do you know he was small? Number one, he was going to fake water. In the Jews culture or in that culture, women used to have servants. Able to rich women would have servants and that is the work of ser. So the fact that she herself was going to fake water show showed economic status. Number two, she was not married to the Jews was actually licensed to own property. When we are not married, you don't own anything because everything belong to the man. So this woman did not have anything. So he was he was poor. The Bible talks about coming to the well at noon. That was also indicating something about her. This was the time where no one was around. No one was well drinking water. Traditionally women could drink water early in the morning or late evening but not at noon. So there was this woman was avoiding something meaning that she was lonely. This woman was lonely. This woman was rejected. This well that Jesus found him was a very distant well. She had actually passed other ways. Meaning there was something that was driving her to go very far positively because she was not accepted in the community where she she came from. So she was a rejected woman. So again it brings in the issue of a barrier. How do we reach out to these people? Another one was a spiritual barrier. When Jesus introduced the message, she was very quick to say you Jews worship in Jerusalem. We worship. We don't worship in Jerusalem. There was a religious barrier. There was a religious barrier. Another thing about this spirituality is about a lifestyle. Jesus confronted her. You are you don't have a husband and even the one that we're living with is not yours. So again revealing the sinful life that she was actually. So in this passage we see a very important lesson that barriers should not prevent us from sharing the gospel. Praise the name of the Lord. That no barrier should actually prevent you from sharing the gospel. Whether it is cultural, whether it is social, whether it is spiritual, we should not allow it to to to prevent us. Every time the first thing that you you normally encounter, somebody will tell you I am I am belong to this religion or I belong to this denomination. So by that he's telling him there is no need for you to witness to me. It doesn't matter. Maybe he attended only once or he got baptized many years ago. It doesn't matter. But the fact that he has become he has joined a certain religion that actually shield or from with from the gospel. So some people use religion as a barrier. Some use revolution. Sometimes we fear to witness to certain people. Possibly there are people high in society. Maybe they look rich, influential and powerful. And we ask ourself, do these people need the gospel? Do these people need this message? How can a young person, how a poor person, how can I be able to share the gospel to this very rich and very influential person? Or sometimes the person will be very low in society. It could be the people that have been classified as very low people in society. How can I be able to share the gospel of these people? Maybe if I start a conversation, this man will begin maybe asking for support or asking for begin to be something from me. So we normally shy away from sharing the gospel based on economic background. On Thursday we hosted the bon in my home for for lunch. My wife had started the ministry to reach out to these people. Normally they come sit there as they waiting for passengers and at one time she started a conversation and managed to convince them to come for lunch and we had a very good time with them and they confessed that many people look down upon them. Most people consider them a social conflict that they warn our children be careful of the border border people. They are not good people. So they confess that we are not treated very well in society. And many of them confess that they are not part of any church. They don't go to church on Sundays. And many of them confess also that they've got a little habits that are not very good. In fact, they say some of the work that they doing is not very beneficial because many of them ended up betting many some ended up bringing an order and we were able to reach them uh and invite them to go to whichever church that they really wanted and we were very blessed and all the response. That is an example of crossing the barriers. Crossing the barriers to reach out to other people. Some of us have workers at home. Have we actually share the gospel this year? Whether it's outside or household or some of us also are privileged to have workers in our school work. Some of us have bosses out there. Can we be able to reach out to them for the gospel or we have allowed these positions socio economic status to hinder us from crossing these boundaries. Jesus in this story is telling us we need not to allow these barriers to prevent us. Number two, it's about opportunities. The Bible says that Jesus left Judea and went to Galilee. If you can look at that map, Judea is south. Gal is up in the north. Traditionally because of the relationship between the Jews and the Gentiles, they avoided going through Samaria. In fact, they crossed over over the Jordan River to that place called Ber and then went up and then crossed the river again at the top somewhere near the Sea of Cal so that they were they could avoid going through Samaria. But on this particular day, Jesus decided to go through Samaria. Uh I did I think he did that intention because he wanted to get that message that it is important even this. Now look at what is happening here. Number one, he met this woman at the well. He met this woman at the well. A well is a common place where everybody goes. A well is not a religious place. It was not a church service. It was not a crusade. It was not one of the programs that we make. It is an ordinary place. What does this mean? God actually present opportunities in any place, even in ordinary places. Number two, it was at noon. It was at noon. A time that it was not expected. You see if it was in the morning we would assume that he knew that so many women would be coming to fake water. So he would take advantage of the numbers. Uh it could be to be accepted but it was a where no one expected again we know that the cost must be shared at any time the opportunity present itself. You don't have to wait for Sunday. You don't have to wait for the day we organize for doortodoor evangelism. We don't have to wait for people to come to church. We need to do it where we find them. It could be in the marketplace. It could be in the shop. It could be in the place of that could be righteous. It was not the plan encounter. Jesus arranged that I was going to meet this woman. This woman arrived. He knew that he was going to meet Jesus. Everybody was on this on this business. This man was coming for water. Jesus was on this journey going to to them to Gary. It was not hard. Again, we learned that doing evangelism sometimes does not require prior arrangement. God actually presents an opportunity for you and we need to use it. You know the story of the Ethiopian unac. Philip was his way and the Philip was suddenly going on his journey also and it began a coincidence that the Philip was reading the book of Isaiah and Philip was also there and he had been reading and from that he established a conversation about what he was reading and through that Philip was able to lead the children to Christ and eventually baptize him. Yes, God presents opportunities. It presents opportunities in many places. Another point is that do not underestimate the value of one one person. Jesus spend time with this one woman. It was not I don't know whether it was economical in terms of time to spend all your time and energy on this one person. But Jesus knew the importance of one. Verse 43, we see the impact of that one. Verse 43, it says after 2 days, it's not um after 2 days he left for Galilee. Now Jesus himself has appointed one Oh no, it's not verse 14. It is. Let's begin from 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's wisdom. He told me everything I did. So when Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with him and he stayed two days and because of the his words many more became believers. You see the result of investing in this one woman and investing your time and energy in this one woman later on a whole town actually came to believe in Jesus as a result of this. Jesus ignored this woman and maybe waited for an opportunity to have a big open air concert in in town or a big service somewhere that opportunity could have been lost. So Jesus saw the importance of one soul one person one person he was able to reach many because of that we've seen people you use creatively of God even in this church I remember when came here a few years ago we didn't know the potential that he He was just a lone missionary not sent by anybody without support. We didn't even know what he was doing. He even his physical appearance was not the way he is today. He was a very strong slender young man. Um so he requested that we partner with him. Um actually we after some discussion we accepted we welcomed him to be part of this congregation. We left him for training at NC fish where we supported him for 2 years after graduation. He left back to the missionary and when we you hear about um the places he has sent you heal the other day that he was in Niger. He has seen in Jan, he has seen Tanzania, very many of those countries and like right now he's talking about last year for example in Europe where doors are opening there to reach out. You can ask yourself is was it worth it investing with this person? The answer is yes. Sometimes investing in one person actually may bring a lot of results in the kingdom of God. So let's not underrate the importance of one one soul who comes to Christ. The Bible says heaven rejoices when one person repents. Praise the name of the Lord. If heaven is happy, how should we be happy when one soul repents? Next point is that it starts with a simple conversation. Sharing the gospel does not require a lot of theology. It does not require you to know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. All you need is to know how to reach out to him. First of all, let's establish a relationship. It started with water here. Please give me some water and that's how the conversation began actually portray themselves as a person who needs sometimes we need to put ourselves in that position so that we can have relationship with others. I remember a family where one day they sent the child to go and request for south Truth be here. So sometimes we actually need to show that we also need so the moment they give us then they will also free to come here. So in other words, we'll establish a relationship. Actually, Jesus was doing the same. He could have actually picked a mother for himself, but he wanted to have the conversation, the relationship with this woman. And through that, he was able to lead to this real need. By the way, we believe from health needs. Felt needs are what we go through in life. Siasa, politics, financial challenges, the weather, squeezy, squeezy, squeezing. We we need and then we go deeper to the real needs of the people which are the deep spiritual needs of these people. And that's how Jesus took this woman from literal water to the real deep need of this woman that the issue of salvation and and that is exactly what he did. He was able to lead them this person to know Jesus as Lord and Savior of this life. Many people write Bible normal things. I remember some years back when I was in the school ministry, I was ser as a chaplain in the school and we used to have morning devotion which started at 5 in the morning. Initially everybody did not know believe that it was not going to succeed because students were in number five who are praying the whole school was it wasn't something anybody was but when we started they were few but slowly the numbers increased until the whole student body were assembling by five to listen to God. So many people were shocked and I was also shocked because I didn't know I was going to succeed in this. But it was one year ago I met one of the students who was is now a man you but he was a student at that time and he he revealed the the the truth to me. He told me do you know the reason why we are coming in the morning? Why we waking up? He said it was because of the stories that you used to share. Actually it was around 207 208 and the political tension of the country was very high. So every morning I would share with them what was happening from there. So this is what has happened. This is so everybody wanted to come and hear what is this new thing that is happening. So I will share that one and then use read a portion of scripture and pray and that is that end up being a channel which I can be able to witness on the word of God. So it starts the conversation. It starts the conversation. How are you? How is your family? How are children doing? How is your business? How is this country? Some of us have football which seems to be doing well and through that you can be able to lead somebody to Christ. The the other point is that everyone can be used by God. Everyone can be used by God. We are all called to be witnesses. We are all called to be witnesses. as I've already stated will be commanded and it does not matter your social status. It does not matter your economic status or spiritual status. We are all called to be witnesses. This power woman did not meet any qualities any qualities of the servant of God. A woman who had been married five times and was in a wrong marriage. A woman who was a social med and a survivor which does not meet all the qualities of anyone who attend any message to anybody but we see the results when he took out the task and became as a a witness many people came to Christ. So I want to challenge this morning that any one of us whether you are young, you are old, you are rich, you are poor, you are a man, you are a woman, we are called to be witnesses. Praise the name of the Lord. Even the students out there, you are called to be witnesses, you are called to be witnesses of Christ in the schools where you are in your places of business. Any one of us can be used by God. There is no one who is considered unlikely. The Bible have many full of examples of people who are used by God. In the book of Kings, people of leprosy were used by God to rescue the people of his side. God even used a donkey to speak. God used a blind beggar to witness. By the way, the most influential where you reaching out to is a testimony. It's a testimony. In fact, what this woman did was only to share testimony. He went to them and said, \"You know what? I have met a man who has told me everything about myself told would this be the prophet, the Messiah?\" And people were interested because she was sharing his encounter with Jesus. Remember the story of the blind man where Jesus healed him and then he went out and the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were more happy. So one time they met this man in the crowd and they asked him, \"Are you the man who who was healed?\" He said, \"Yes.\" Do you know the man who healed you is a sinner? But the man who responded, he said, I don't know. I don't know that man. All I know is that I was blind but now I see. That is all I know. And that's a testimony. This is what happened to me. I don't know much. You don't have to know justification, glorification, sanctification. I don't know what all those complex knowledge is. All you need to know is that Jesus saves. This is the way I am. I was and this is the way I am now. This is what I've experienced and that is what it means to share the gospel. You can be you God can use anyone. God can use anyone in business. Um They can sometimes use um sales agents to go out to market a product but sometimes they use customers to market an agent to to market a product. For example, look at this situation. A sales agent comes to you and tells you this is the best speaker. This is the best in the market. You need to buy it. And then somebody from product comes to you and tells you we have used this speaker for the last 8 years and as s cannot break. The sound is wonderful. Which one are you going to buy? Which I the one that is being saved by a salesman or the one person who has used it? The person who has used it. Yes. the power of a satisfied. We can be witnesses of Christ. You don't have to be evangelist or a pastor or anybody. All you need to know is you are you you have benefited from Christ that qualifies you to be a witness. The other one is the principle of sewing and reaping. That one is found in verse 37. Jesus talked about two people. One is sewing and another one is reaping. The one who is sewing will not see the results. Sewing is somewhere the seed and forgetting about it. That is sometimes how witness is. Sometimes you only share and you don't see the response. They must make a decision or they can even plant reject now. So sometimes can be discouraging but I think this is what Jesus is saying. He's saying there is a time for sewing and there is also time for harvesting. Peter Capu the founder of A was just in this country for 3 years. He lived only for 3 years and he died. But today we have more than a million followers of NC because he planted the sick and others after the city. So don't get tired sewing the sick and witnessing because in the due time we will see the others. Finally, leading others to Christ is the most fulfilling work. Verse four, the disciples comes back. They find Jesus still in the same place. They left him and they asked him and let me read from that one. Meanwhile, his disciples acting, rabbi, eat something. But he said to them, I have food. Eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples say to each other, could someone have brought him food? Verse 34, my food, say Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent him and to finish his work. In other words, he's saying, I fulfillment and happiness by wickedness, by doing the will of God. That is what gives me joy. That is what gives me happiness. It's not the food. It is not a career. It is not the success in business. It is not the houses that I build. It is not the positions that I have. It is doing the will of God that gives me fulfillment and happiness in life. So I want to remind each one of us this morning that there is something there is a post that God has started in this world. There is a mission that God has started. And the most fulfilling thing in life is to be part of that mission. To be part of that course is the most fulfilling most fulfilling thing. Yesterday I attended a prayer day and the student tires and I saw one but I didn't have I wish to speak I would have recognized that. There is one boy who wrote pastor and I think many of you are surprised and I think if your son or a daughter comes home and tells you my career is to be a pastor you will ask for prayers. This one is now cutting a direct license to poverty and all kinds of problems. But let me tell you the other side. Doing God's work is the most fulfilling work because it is actually what God has done. It is very fulfilling to do God's work. We thank God all for the different that you have in this church. Those of you who are in will tell you how joyful it is to be in God's service to come here every week for my practice and practice all this good mission here. It keeps me All those significance processes millions of political will remain here. And I know my father. we have done something about us. So that is why we say it is why I have something more important and more. So this morning I want to please the community members are their Here I am big. Oh, it could be anybody else. It could be. It could be. Come to the end. Last question. How many of you with the I may Yes. ask us. We also keep us in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We have this great and Wow. Generation Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is the most beautiful. So we will help you again. that doesn't ask. In the name of you this morning Yeah. I pray that you give with them. Use them for the glory and honor of your name. I pray for the rest of the church that God we are not seated back but we are also here that you use us in the outfit and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. You can use us oh God. We are asking for forgiveness whatever that we have gone astray and we go even my father go now in the ministry strengthen us once again and use us for the glory and honor of your name. I pray for these three hours right now in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit we pray and believe. Amen. God bless you so much. You are blessed of the lord and may God bless you for the glory and honor in the name of Jesus. I want us to thank God because of the message of the delay for the message and all of us we are here so that we can serve God. I want us to pray as the choir house. Last week also we had announced that Kinder Care are going to present. I don't know if they are ready because you are there today but we can just shout out the choir because they have come. We pray for the offerings. Let's prepare ourselves to give the tithes. Uh I'm reminded will be on fourth that is next week. You're welcome Kaka next week to present. Let's pray for the offerings.

         "Abdul Rahman knew at this point that he had two choices: either meet this with hostility, anger, and maybe even violence (which would have been the short path), or venture on the long and difficult road to recovery through patience, which was the road that so many of the Prophets had tread. He chose the path of the Prophets. He gave up his prestigious medical career and easy life, and along with his wife Umm Suhaib, returned to Africa to dedicate their lives to healing the people there – physically, emotionally, mentally, but most importantly, spiritually.\nPlanting the Seeds\nIn 1980, al-Sumait started an initiative that eventually became Direct Aid. On his initiative, al-Sumait said that “ the aim was to help societies that the world has forgotten and to develop them, so we tried to develop these societies by providing education programs amongst other things ”. The organisation provided schools, healthcare centres, wells, and mosques. One of the main seeds they planted was the welfare of orphans. They would nurture these orphans from a young age with the education and support they needed, until they graduated from university, some even with postgraduate Master’s degrees.\nOne of the main things that Abdul Rahman noticed was that despite the majority of countries with Islam as their main religion having up to a 60% Muslim population, the government and ministers of these countries were mainly Christian. The reason for this was that the average Muslim child barely made it to secondary school, whilst the Christian child had help to progress through to higher education, enrol in a university outside of Africa, and return as a doctor or a politician. What was Abdul Rahman’s solution to this? He founded universities in Tanzania, Zanzibar, and Kenya.\nThe fruition of sowing these seeds became clear in a short amount of time. After al-Sumait’s death, there was a gathering of foreign ministers in Kuwait, where even the Foreign Minister of Malawi attended. He asked to be taken to the grave of al-Sumait, which he visited according to the Islamic tradition. When asked why he had chosen to come here, he answered that he was one of the orphans that had been sponsored by Abdul Rahman.\nNear enough 40 years later, Direct Aid now has 34 offices in 40 African countries.\nThe Mission of the Missionaries\nAbdul Rahman mentioned to a trusted friend of his how, in 1972 whilst he was studying in Britain, he heard of a convention that was taking place in Colorado attended by most heads of nations along with the Pope. Their agenda was Africa and how by the year 2000, the entire continent would follow Christianity. They had taken this task upon themselves and gathered a huge amount of wealth and resources in order to fulfil this mission, along with the full support of the Vatican. His friend narrated that Abdul Rahman did not expand any further into the matter or say what he intended to do – he only returned back to Kuwait.\nFor the next three decades, Abdul Rahman became a thorn in the Vatican’s side. Whilst Christian missionaries were many and took full advantage of the hunger and poverty in the region by trading bread for Christian conversion, Abdul Rahman provided for whoever was in need, regardless of colour, creed, or race. There were entire villages of Muslims who had given up their religion and accepted Christianity in exchange for food and water. Al-Sumait, on the other hand, insisted that the people learned their own languages, culture, and even songs. He did not want any political interference and remained adamant that there should be no middle man between the aid and the people. He accurately manifested the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and showcased to the world that Islam was the only real solution to any form of racism or bias. Naturally, this caused problems for Abdul Rahman, and there were at least two assassination attempts against his life. Allāh saved His servant so he could continue with this blessed work.",

[Music] [Music] [Music] India franchise India. Hello and good afternoon everyone and thank you so much for joining us on this webinar called business opportunity overchai. Business opportunity overchai is a webinar series presented by the management of franchise India every day at 12:00 in the afternoon with an aim to introduce you to a new business opportunity. Over the last 27 years, Franchise India has helped thousands of investors in selecting the right franchise business for them. If you're watching us right now, you are just a few step behind to take a decision to come into franchising um and your entrepreneurship. Um in in in today's webinar, we are happy to introduce you an electric vehicle manufacturing brand called ARD Group and RAP Eco Motors. So the RAP echo motors is a Hyderabad based professionally managed company with over 20 years of experience in the automo industry. It initially specialized in the borewell spares uh gen sets Yamaha motorcycles and agri machinery before expanding into petrol and diesel three-wheeler um manufacturing for international market. In recent years, the group has strategically diversified um into the electric vehicle manufacturing battery operated three three-wheers and that aligned with India's green mobility goal. To talk more about this, I'm joined with Mr. Pam Chabria. He is the COO with the 40 plus years of experience led diversification into EV industry, EV and international market. Um and we also have um um u Mr. Arbal Krishnan who's the former naval officer and electronics gold medalist drives EV product development and green initiative. Apart from that I'm joined with my colleagues Faison. Faison F is the key account manager. He's responsible for uh North India business expansion for this brand. We have Sarat is the business head from of Bangalore. Then we have Viml. Viml is the business head from east. So that's our team is and um you know during this webinar in case if you will have any question related to the brand or the business uh my request is to please keep on posting it into the Q&A box. If you have joined through the mobile you will get two option one is the chat and the other one is the Q&A. I mean it is it is absolutely fantastic to put all your queries into the Q&A and u we will come back with the answers once the presentation is over. Right. So let's let's get started now. I would um welcome and u you know request promoter to take the lead. Let's get started. Talk about the brands and the business opportunities that you're offering to uh the investors. Yeah. Over to you sir. Good morning and good afternoon everybody. My name is Pramot Chabria. I'm the co-founder of RAP Motors. I we have been in automo line for a long long time. Earlier we were into retail having showrooms of Yamaha, Atul Auto, Escorts, Class Harvesters, Jansets so on and so forth. About 20 years back we got into the manufacturing of three wheelers. So we have been manufacturing now three wheelers for the last 20 years. Can you put up my company profile now or somebody can put that up? Sure. We have been manufacturing the for the last 20 years and what the company that we are running was a 100% EOU. No domestic sales like I jokingly say we did a what I call a China and India we copied to Bajad machine totally and go to the photographs this is all data there's one more company profile with PP which is in PPT I prefer if that is shown so we got into three wheel manufacturing of three wheelers and we started exporting so far. So far, I can do one thing. I can send the PPT on uh WhatsApp right now. So, you can uh put that up. Okay, sir. Sure. We can do that. Yeah. Me? Yeah. I'm just sending you the P50 right now, so you can put that up. Okay. Okay. This is called Murphy's law. What you want at that time doesn't come and it is available when you are not bothered about it. Anyway, you we can I'll just put up on PPT which is not what I wanted to show to you. But something is better than nothing. You can just put the we sent you by WhatsApp just now. So we started manufacturing three wheelers and we started exporting them. We so far we have exported to about 20 countries across the world and it speaks volume that we have been competing against Baj Pio Mahendra all over TVs all over. Our biggest advantage of our product was visual acceptance as I say because it's a known fact that all over the world the best design free is bajads best design free is bajad so what we did was copied so if you have to copy try copy the best one so we copied baj and as you can see it is looking just like bajadaj but for this headlight light slightly different so that there is no copyright problem with anybody. The copyright problem does not happen at all. This is how it happened. Since we were manufacturing already manufacturing three wheelers, lot of people approached us all over and uh when electrical EV market started in India, some people approached us and wanted us to make an EV. At that time we were very happy making petrol and exporting and when we started when we decided okay we will do EV for you. We realize there are in EVs also there are there are certain categories like L3 and L5 L3 is a ricksha model that you see all over in north where it is more like a ricksha than an auto whereas ours was an auto. So what we did was we designed an specific L3. If you go go up a little, you'll find the picture also. You can see in the second slide which looks like a bajach old model bajach. This we made as an L3 model which was you know something for a customer or for anybody. The most important thing in life is promotion. Nobody wants a demotion. Everybody wants a promotion. So all the pedal richa people all over north happily went on to irrias but in south where pedal rickshas did were not existing uh people did not want to buy an Ishia because a drive auto driver doesn't want to drive a ricksha you want to drive an auto so we designed this L3 model which looks like an auto but is it passes the e-ria category what we say L3 I'll tell you people the difference between L3 L3 and L5 is not very big. In L3 the machine width cannot be more than 1 m. L5 is the normal auto that you see on roads. At that point of time the L5 specifications were not available with AI and IAT for approvals. So we have designed this picture what you are seeing this an L3 model which comes under the EIA category where the width is less is 1 m and the speed is not more than 25 30 kilometers. So this we have been selling in the south not acceptance even for the ricksha fellow as I said promotion is the root cause for everything. A rsha fellow will happily buy an L3 auto who which brand is Rani we call it Rani and he will not feel demoted. So this caught up everywhere but the market now is shifting towards L5. If you go to the next slide, you can see the L5 machine. What you have seen in the first slide also. This is the L5 machine which looks like a absolute baj auto. Other than the small lights we have exported to all the countries that you are seeing in that slide. UK, Japan, Nigeria, Ethopia, Egypt, Bellis, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Peru, Bles. So these are the countries we have exported already exported our they all these places were exporting our petrol models when we were running an EOU. We have sent EVs to Liberia, Tanzania, it good good amount of enquies are there but in exports where three wheelers as I said is the cheapest mode of commercial transport the most acceptable machine as a commercial machine for people's earnings but in which is very popular in Africa but the problem in Africa is there is no there is not enough power 24 hours to charge the batteries. So now I come to my product L3. I've already told you it is very popular all over not because it looks like an auto. It looks like auto doesn't look like a Yeah, hold this slide there my dear friend. We have got cargo models. We have got delivery vans and we have driveaway chi. This is all L3. What your pictures you are seeing is L3 and same can be got in L5 also here what happens people like you see lot of foots so drive away chi anything can be built all e-commerce companies want a delivery vans and e- loader is standard machines everybody uses so L3 is very popular but the future because of the slow speed government is not allowing them on the main roads and big cities big cities and on the main roads also they are all proposing L5. The machines that you see of Bajage, Mahindra, Pajio, PVS are all L5 models and they are our competition because all reputed companies are manufacturing products on 48 volts and so is our machine on 48 volts and we are giving an option of various op for for sale as a sales tool. We are giving lot of options where the customer can I mean uh before I go there let me make a few things. Our biggest advantage for our L5 product I will speak about the advantage of L5 product before I go into sales tools and all the biggest advantage of our L5 product is it is ripped all the spare part are interchangeable bajors. So every nook and corner India or for that matter world there are spare parts available there are mechanic available mechanics available because for an auto there should be zero downtime the the driver is a poor fellow he if he stops the machine he loses money so we have made sure that all components are same as bad so there is no problem with the spare parts or service and most important our machine is 100% Indian we have got nothing Chinese all other companies some companies I'm talking about the smaller companies major companies are anyway doing Indian so we are on par with them in quality and for quality I can tell you that since we have been competing against the major brands all over the world I mean that itself speaks volumes because we could compete with them because we were giving quality if you are not better than them, you're on par with them because end en\r\n",

         "95,62,72,82... BREAKING: Traoré & Erdoğan sign $5.2B Ankara deal; target 1.2M jobs across the Sahel\nSeptember 16, 2025 — In Ankara, Captain Ibrahim Traoré and President Erdoğan announced a $5.2B Ankara deal aimed at building a Turkey–Sahel industrial corridor $5.2B across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger.

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nankara signs big s5.2b with traore\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:history. In the heart of Anchora, Ibrahim Trouore of Burkina Faso and Reab Taib Erdogan of Turkey signed a deal worth 5.2 billion. Not a loan dressed as charity, not an IMF package tied to gold or uranium, but a partnership agreement promising to generate 1.2 million jobs and establish what could become the largest industrial corridor in Africa. The announcement reverberated instantly, shaking both allies and critics alike. For decades, Africa has been offered development through contracts written in Washington, Paris, and London. Contracts that often left the continent poorer than before. But this moment felt different. Turkey, itself, a nation that straddles East and West, now emerges as a principal partner in Africa's bold new experiment. Factories, transport hubs, and trade corridors, not aid handouts, form the pillars of this agreement. Could this be the model of cooperation Africa has been waiting for? The numbers alone command attention. A $5.2 billion injection equals nearly 2.5% of Burkina Faso's entire GDP. The promise of 1.2 million jobs could reduce unemployment across the Sahel by double digits. Compare that to traditional aid packages measured in millions, not billions, that often evaporate into bureaucracy. And yet, beyond numbers lies symbolism. For the first time, an African leader is turning away from debt relief schemes and toward an industrial partnership rooted in production and sovereignty. Is this not the truest definition of independence? Predictably, the West reacted with unease. Commentators in London warned of geopolitical risks. Analysts in Washington described the deal as a strategic realignment. But on the streets of Wuagadugu, Bamako, and Name, the reaction was one of pride. Citizens saw not just a contract, but a statement that Africa's resources and labor can fuel African industries, not merely foreign stock markets. Could this be the moment the narrative shifts from Africa as deter to Africa as architect of its own destiny? The deal between Troure and Erdogan is more than numbers on paper. It is a challenge to old systems, a declaration that partnerships can be forged without chains and a warning that the global balance of power is shifting. But what does this mean for the wider world from Wall Street to Beijing? The $5.2 billion deal signed in Anchora is not just about railways, factories, or jobs. It is a political statement, loud, clear, and impossible to ignore. For the first time in decades, an African alliance has turned eastward, not to Moscow or Beijing, but to Ankora. Turkey, a NATO member, yet often at odds with Western capitals, has positioned itself as a bridge between continents. By investing in Africa's industrial corridor, Anchora signals its readiness to play a new role in the emerging multipolar world order. Could this be the opening chapter of Turkey as Africa's strategic partner? The implications are global. In Washington, analysts worry about losing influence in a region long treated as an aid dependent zone. In Brussels, concerns grow that Turkish African corridors could redirect trade flows worth billions of US dollars annually, bypassing European ports. Meanwhile, Beijing watches with caution, knowing that Ankara's bold move may complicate its own belt and road ambitions. If Africa can now choose between Washington, Beijing, and Ankara, does this not redefine the very map of global power? This agreement is more than economics. It is a symbol that Africa is no longer the silent subject of others strategies. It is becoming the stage where a new balance of power is rehearsed. But what exactly lies inside this deal that makes it so disruptive. The ink on the Ankora agreement was barely dry when its details began to circulate and they revealed not a loan trap, not a donation wrapped in conditions, but a blueprint for transformation. Unlike IMF contracts that mortgage natural resources, this deal was built on investment, infrastructure, and technology. It was a packact that spoke not of dependency, but of building capacity. At the heart of the agreement lies infrastructure. With a commitment of $2.8 8 billion. Turkey pledged to finance and construct highways linking Uaga Dugu, Bamako, and Name, a new regional railway system capable of moving both goods and people across borders and modern airports to open new corridors of trade. For the Sahel Alliance, long strangled by poor logistics. This was not just concrete and steel. It was freedom of movement. Could sovereignty truly exist without the power to move goods across one's own land? The second pillar is industry, backed by $1.4 $4 billion. Textile factories, agroprocessing hubs, and technology parks will be built aimed at keeping value added production inside Africa rather than exporting raw materials for pennies. For decades, cocoa from Ghana, cotton from Burkina Faso, and uranium from Niger have been shipped abroad, generating trillions in global markets while local farmers remained poor. This deal reverses the equation. Factories on African soil, jobs for African hands, and products stamped made in the Sahel. Is this not the essence of self-reliance? Energy forms the third pillar. With $800 million allocated, the deal prioritizes renewable power plants, solar grids, and crossber transmission lines. In a region where nearly 50% of the population still lacks access to electricity, this is more than infrastructure. It is justice. Energy is the bloodstream of modern economies and with it comes light for schools, power for hospitals, and fuel for industry. If Africa controls its own power, who can control Africa? Finally, health and education anchor the agreement. Though smaller in financial scale, $200 million, this investment may prove the most lasting. New hospitals, universities, and vocational training centers will rise, coupled with scholarships and teacher exchanges. Technology transfer is not just about machines. It is about minds. By insisting on knowledge transfer, Troué ensured that the deal was not a one-time transaction, but the seed of long-term independence. Can a continent that educates its own engineers and doctors ever again be told it is poor? Every clause of the Anara agreement reflects a philosophy, partnership instead of patronage, and every number tells a story. Billions invested not in resource extraction, but in roads, factories, grids, and schools. For the first time, Africa sees a contract that builds rather than bleeds. But the question remains, will these promises survive the test of implementation, or will they be met with the same resistance from global powers that fear a sovereign industrial Africa? Numbers tell a story, and here they speak louder than speeches. The Turkey Sahel agreement is set to generate 480,000 direct jobs and another 720,000 indirect jobs, reshaping the labor landscape of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. That is over 1.2 million livelihoods, a figure that dwarfs traditional aid projects, which rarely create more than a few thousand positions. For a region where youth unemployment has hovered around 30%, these jobs are not statistics. They are lifelines. Could this be the first time foreign investment empowers Africa's workers instead of exploiting them? Beyond jobs lies training, the cornerstone of true sovereignty, the deal includes programs to train 150,000 workers in technology and industry, from engineers in renewable energy to technicians in agrop processing. Even more groundbreaking, 25,000 management positions will be reserved for African professionals, ensuring that factories and projects are not just built in Africa, but run by Africans. This detail alone marks a radical departure from past contracts where decision-making often stayed in foreign hands. Is this not the definition of partnership rather than dependency? By combining employment with education, the agreement turns raw labor into skilled human capital, Africa's most undervalued resource. But the question lingers, how will this massive workforce reshape the Sahel's political and economic future? What makes Turkey different? Why did the Sahel Alliance trust Ankara when it has rejected contracts from Paris, Washington, and even Beijing? The answer lies in history, culture, and strategy. Unlike European powers, Turkey has no colonial past in Africa. There are no memories of resource plunder under a Turkish flag, no scars of forced treaties, no monuments to exploitation. This absence is not a weakness. It is Anchora's greatest advantage. In a continent where memory shapes politics, trust begins, where past wounds do not exist. Could this be why Anchora's arrival feels less like intrusion and more like partnership? Second, the bond of faith and culture runs deep in Mali, Niger, and Bkina Faso, nations where Islam is central to daily life. Turkey presents itself not as a foreign overseer, but as a fellow traveler. Shared traditions, familiar values, and religious solidarity, transform business deals into something more profound. Cooperation anchored in cultural respect. How often in Africa's dealings with the West has respect truly been part of the equation? Third, Turkeykey's technology and industry stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the West. From drones to construction, from textiles to renewable energy, Anchora has proven it can deliver cutting edge solutions without demanding political submission. A $5.2 billion package with built-in technology transfer signals, something the IMF never offered. Not just capital, but capability. When machines, factories, and skills remain in African hands, does that not redefine the meaning of independence? Finally, there is the principle of win-win. The Anchora deal does not mortgage gold or oil. It does not demand austerity or privatization. Instead, it channels billions into highways, factories, grids, and schools, projects that benefit both sides. Turkey gains markets and influence. Africa gains jobs, infrastructure, and dignity. This balance rare\r\n",

I first sat in this gradation square when I graduated with my bachelor degree in 2011 and later earned my executive MBA in 2014. To be here now celebrating your moment truly feels like a full cycle experience. Like many of you today, I once sat where you are, excited, hopeful, and perhaps a little uncertain about what lay ahead. My career began in 2009 while still a student here as an intern at Stanic Bank in Churomo Westlands. I wasn't given glamorous task. I filed documents, spool data from the data store and ran erands. At first, I wondered if this was really what I had studied for. But in carrying out those small task, I discovered a timeless truth. Greatness is born out of small beginnings. After graduation, I joined Stanic Bank South Sudan where I spent nearly a decade eventually becoming country head of Standib, the asset management arm of Standard Bank and Liberty Group of South Africa. Those years shaped me as a leader and taught me the value of patience, persistence and resilience. Later together with colleagues, we co-ounded Alpha Commercial Banks in South Sudan. Building a bank from scratch was tough, but it reinforced an important truth. Leadership is not about preserving what already exist. It's about daring to keep what does not yet exist. My journey then took me overseas to Australia where I worked with A&Z Bank, the leading bank in Asia Pacific. There I experienced world-class banking, high standards and a culture of excellence. That opportunity gave me confidence that education can place you on the global stage. Yet, it also reminded me of something vital. Global exposure only has value if it translate into local impact. That realization brought me back home. I returned to South Sudan to help establish Horizon Bank, an institution built not only to provide financial services, but also to contribute to nation building in a fragile economy. Every account open and every loan dispersed is more than a transaction. It is a step towards building trust, creating opportunity and strengthening resilience. Through all these stages, one truth has guided me. Education has been my passport. My first degree at USIU opened the door to my career. My executive MBA shape sharpened my leadership and strategic thinking. In 2015, I pursued a business economic leadership course at Stalin Bush University in South Africa, which strengthened my capacity to lead with vision in complex environment. And today, as I pursue my doctorate of business administration, I am researching how fragile economies can build resilient banking systems to drive sustainable growth. Nelson Mandela said, \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\" He is what echo through my journey and they align perfectly with the promise of this university. Education to take you places. Indeed, education has taken me from the lecture halls of USIU to boardrooms across Africa and beyond. And now it will take each of you to places you may not yet imagine. For my journey, I leave you with three lessons. One, resilience is a mindset. The obstacles you encounter are not barriers. They are stepping stones. Number two, education is lifelong. Graduation is not the end of learning. It is the beginning of a journey that will keep unlocking new opportunities. Leadership is service. Titles and pos and positions may change, may fade rather, but the institution you built, the people you have lived and the impact you leave behind will endure. Class of 2025, resilience is the bridge between your dream and your destiny. Your USIU education can take you anywhere from Safari Park to Juba, from Nairobi to Melbourne, from lecture halls to boardrooms. But truth success will not be measured by how far you go. It will be measured by how much you give back, by the lives you touch, and by the institution you help build. And so today, that responsibility and that opportunity rest in your hands. Use it boldly, use it wisely, and use it to create a future worthy of your dreams. I am proud to be a double alumnus of USIU. And today, I'm even prouder of each of you. Congratulation, class of 2025. [Applause] The future is not waiting for you. The future is waiting on you. Best of luck as you step out into the world. May you carry with you the courage to dream big, the resilience to overcome challenges, and the wisdom to make a difference. Go forth with confidence and conquer new horizons. The world is waiting for your impact. Best of luck in all your future endeavors. God bless you. As I end my speech, I uh I I didn't I hadn't uh uh you know introduce my dear wife. She's seated here. Her name is Dr. Chuty. Dr. Chuty is a medical doctor. She's a pediatrician doctor and she currently uh works at Gate Children Hospital. And both of us are from South Sudan. And thank you very much, professor, for the kind introduction. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Thank you, Mr. Maliv. Our validictorian this year is Runak Vinodri Solani. [Applause] Runak is a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Technology graduate. He hails from Tanzania and earned the highest academic achievement with a GPA of 3.966. [Applause] Let's cheer him up. 3.966 on a scale of four. The chief guest, Ambassador Dennis Aari, Board of Trustees, University Council, Management Board, University Senate, faculty, students, staff, and alumni present, parents, and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, and the graduating class of 2025. Good morning. When I was a child, I used to imagine graduation as a single shining moment. Walking across a stage, wearing a gown, receiving a degree, and smiling for the cameras. But now that we are here, I realize graduation is not just a moment. It is a patchwork. It is built from countless small sacrifices, sleepless nights, fears conquered, friendships made, and lessons learned. Each of us carries our our own unique pieces and together they formed a beautiful picture that is the class of 2025. A week ago I received an email from the university. It was short but its message carried enormous weight. I was selected as this year's validictorian. For a moment I froze. Along with the joy came a deep sense of fear because I had only one and a half days to write this speech. I thought to myself, what can I possibly say that is worthy of this honor? And then I smiled because I realized that I've not been preparing for this speech on paper. I've been preparing for it throughout my entire journey here. Every late night, every exam, every friendship formed, and every hardship endured has been a rehearsal for this moment. Three years ago, I earned my first 4.0 GPA. [Applause] And some of my friends teased me saying, \"Here comes the future valadictorian.\" At the time, it felt like a joke, but it planted a seed in me. We will laugh and even playfully reass what I might say. Quietly I told myself, \"Yes, I want this. I'll work for this. And one day, I'll stand on the graduation square.\" And now here I am. [Applause] But this stage, this microphone, this honor, it is not just about me. It is about us. It is about the graduating class of 2025 and the remarkable journey we have all walked together. We survived the chaos of group projects where one person carried the weight while another's greatest effort was signing the cover page. Those moments taught us patience, resilience, and maybe even forgiveness. We wrestled with term papers stretching 10, 12, even 15 pages, navigating endless citations, formatting rules, and safe assign reports. We refreshed with pounding hearts. And now even this very speech must pass through safe assign. Prove that diligence has been our constant companion all the way to graduation. We ended the notorious responders browser where even a glance away felt like a crime. And yes, we remember the professors who promised the exams will be easy only for the questions to feel like they came from another universe. And who can forget our first days in the library, piling books as if we read them all, only to return most of them untouched at Sinister's end. still pristine but a symbol of the ambition we carried. And then there were the lighter almost humorous companions along the way. Who among us will forget those late nights when desperate for help we turned to chat GPT. [Applause] Whether it was brainstorming essays, revising drafts, or simply reminding us that we were not alone in our struggle, it became our unofficial classmate. The one who never missed the deadline, never said no and never judged our panic at 2:00 a.m. These experiences, some frustrating and some funny, remind us of a deeper truth. Our story as graduates is not of the individual victory but of shared survival, shared resilience and shared growth. Yet I must pause here and ask a question that weighs deeply on my heart. What if the person most deserving of the title validictorian never received it? What if the true validictorian is not standing on this stage but those quietly seated as seated among us today? If I could share this honor, I would give it to the student who stayed up after long shifts just to finish an assignment. To the one who typed essays on a cracked phone screen or borrowed old laptop that froze every few minutes. To the classmate who sold handmade crafts, food or anything they could just to cover fees. To those who rose before down, squeezed into overcrowded buses, walked miles under scorching heat or pouring rain, yet still made it to class with determination. [Applause] I'll recognize the students who studied with heavy hearts, carrying grief or personal struggles, yet refusing to give up. those who were not just students but also providers juggling school work with the responsibility of putting food on the table. Those who sometimes stumbled on a test not out of neglect but because of hunger or exhaustion acclaimed the night before. They may not hold this title but they hold my deepest respect. There are classmates here who had to be their own families. Students who lost a parent or both parents during their studies. Students who raised younger siblings making decisions no one their age should ever have to make. Their perseverance humbles us. And then there are the unsung heroes behind every graduate here. The single parents who worked multiple jobs to keep their children in school. The grandparents The grandparents who became both guardians and providers. The migrant workers who missed birthdays, graduations, and milestones, sending money from far away so that their sons and daughters could have a better future. the families who never wore caps and gowns themselves, but made sure we would. [Applause] I also know that for many of us, the cap and gown we wear today will not remain on our heads for long. After the ceremony, many graduates will take them off and hand them to the very people who made this moment possible. The parents, the guardians, and loved ones who supported us every step of the way. In doing so, we acknowledge that this achievement is not ours only. It is a shared victory, a symbol of sacrifices, their love, and the unwavering belief in our potential. Before I conclude, allow me to honor the many hands and hearts behind this moment. To the parents and guardians, thank you for your sacrifices, your faith, and your unconditional love. To those watching from afar, you are with us in spirit. To those remembered only in memory, your legacy carries us forward. To our professors, mentors, janitors, guards, and staff, thank you for your service. Often unseen, but always felt. Today we close one chapter, but we are not closing the book. The work the world outside the this gates is waiting not just for our knowledge but for our courage our compassion and our creativity. And as we step forward let us remember that sometimes the greatest victory is not in standing here as valadictorian but in refusing to sink despite the waves. Persistence not perfection is the true measure of success. The degrees we hold are not simply certificates of education. their responsibilities to lead with integrity, to innovate with purpose, and to serve with humility. As Denel Washington wisely said, if you don't fail, you're not truly trying. I'll repeat, if you don't fail, you're not truly trying. To achieve what we have never done, we to achieve what we have never had, we must dare to do what we have never done. to take risks, to embrace challenges, and to rise even when the odds are stacked against us. Congratulations, class of 2025. We have reached the summit. But let us never forget that we did not climb alone. This moment belongs not only to us as graduates, but also to the parents, guardians, and families and loved ones who carried us here. And so as we close, there is only one fitting tribute, a standing ovation for them, for us. Class of 2025, let's rise and applaud. [Applause] Thank you very much. Thank you for inspiring your colleagues with your speech and academic performance. No doubt you are a cultivated role model serving deserving emulation by your colleagues and all students. I will now call upon the vice chancellor professor Menda interangui to give his remarks. Professor Man Tarangui is the vice chancellor of USIU Africa. He is a scholar, a teacher, researcher and administration of international reput whose experience and expertise span three decades and cut across diverse geographical locations and institutions. Trained in language education at Kenyata University and cultural anthropology at the University of Illinois. Professor Tarangui has been keen to apply his research interest and focus to teaching and administration. He has taught in universities in Kenya, the United States, Liberia, and carried out research in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and the United States of America. Professor Interangu's teaching and administrative experiences include serving as faculty at St. Lawrence University, Agastana College, Calvin College in the US, Kenyata University, Egaton University and the chief executive officer at the commission for university education Kenya and as the deputy principal in charge of academics, research and student affairs at the National Intelligence and Research University College. Professor Interangui is supporting and elevating the USIU Africa's mission to prepare the next generation of effective, engaged and ethical leaders for the fastch changing Africa and global context. I thought you would clap for me. Good morning. Our chief guest, Ambassador Dennis Aari, who also is our chancellor, the chair, board of trustees, Professor Eileen Wilson Oeleran, members of the board of trustees, the chair of the university council, Mr. Paul Casimu, members of the university council, management board, university senate, faculty, students, staff, and alumni present, parents and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, and our very very very important guests, the class of 2025. Five. Good morning. Allow me to mention that we appreciate our guests that are here. Those ones who have not mentioned including the chair of my former employer commission for university education. several VCs who have come to support us, ambassadors and government representatives, secretary general of Cupet, Mastercard Foundation colleagues, diplomats, CEOs and directors and governor of Narok County. Welcome to the best university in Africa. Today we look at the journey we have taken as an institution as you've heard and we marvel at the strides we've made towards providing access quality and relevant education to our students. When we held our first graduation in 1979 there were just 29 graduates. 29 Today we celebrate 1,519, our largest cohort ever. This is our 47th commencement and our 56th year of existence. 56 years ago when USIU was born, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made history by becoming the first humans to land on the moon. And 47 years ago, legendary longd distanceance runner Henry Renault broke four world records within 81 days. the 3,000 m stipes, 10,000 m, 5,000, and 3,000 m flat. Why do I say this? We saw what our ladies did in Tokyo. And I also I say what we are doing in the education space. We keep charting the path for new ways to do things. Among you for instance are the first graduates of BSc in data science and analytics, bachelor of science in software engineering, bachelor of science in applied biochemistry and bachelor of global leadership and governance. In addition, we also are graduating the very first class of doctoral students in information systems and technology and this time they are all women. [Applause] Let me share a few highlights of the things that we have also been doing. We welcomed our first bachelor of nursing students. We launched a bachelor of science in artificial intelligence and robotics. Master of science in data science and analytics which is offered online and a master of science in clinical pharmacology and the therapeutics. These programs, ladies and gentlemen, are designed to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and experience needed for today's world. And that is why, for instance, we have integrated virtual reality into clinical training, giving our students real world experience before they step into their professional placements. Our faculty and students continue to excel in research and innovation. Last year, our faculty produced 136 publications in high impact journals and secured a nearly $900,000 US in new grants. Our own professor Naomi Noah got national recognition as the best female researcher in applied sciences by the national research foundation. Six undergraduate students in the school of pharmacy and health sciences authored publications with Samuel Ishutiara, a fifth year student publishing nine papers which led him to travel recently to Denmark to present one of his works at the 83rd World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Reflecting on this international experience, Samuel says, and I quote, I shared findings from my research poster on integrating artificial intelligence and tele medicine for management of HIV associated neurological disorders. The experience increased my confidence in research presentations and showed me how student research can contribute to global health innovation. Congratulations students of media and communication won at the global PR boot camp. Those in science and technology presented research in China, developed AI solutions for disability inclusion and ranked third in Africa in NASA's space apps challenge. Hospitality students took place took first place at the future leaders challenge while others won gold, silver, bronze medals for innovations in SDG competitions, securing participation in the SDG Olympia 2025 in Geneva. This year, our students from international relations and international business administration came second in the Lady Joyce Alo International annual alternative dispute resolution mood competition 2025. These achievements, ladies and gentlemen, show that USIU Africa students are competing and winning on the global stage because we are training them to be agile and relevant in this everchanging world. Excellence at USIU Africa is not about academics only. We are committed to producing well-rounded students. Our counseling center continues to provide psychosocial support. Our placement and career services team has expanded employer engagement including a mean career fair that will bring employees employers to our campus on 8th and 9th October. We already have 13 employers confirmed. Graduating class, take note. Our financial aid program grew by 22% this year, allowing us to support nearly 600 students. Students from various academic programs have also participated in our partnership with Langata Women's Prison through the State Department for Correctional Services, bringing skills and knowledge to those of us inside the prison. The university has distinguished itself as the most inclusive high education institution in the region and has postal support for people living with disabilities. At USIU Africa, we are not just diverse, we live it every day. Our sports teams have upheld our pride and heritage, demonstrating resilience and teamwork. The women's 3x3 basketball team won regional competitions and represented Africa in the global championships in China. The men's and women's hockey teams represented the East African community in the Africa club championships in Egypt. The rugby team won the East Africa Varsity Cup and USIU was ranked second out of 39 universities in the East African University Championships, bringing home 49 medals. So, class of 2025, today you live with more than just a degree. You carry with you these qualities of innovation, agility, competition, service, resilience and the vi and the vision that defines our dear USIU Africa. Keep learning, keep questioning and keep creating solutions for a world not yet imagined. The world awaits you. Step into your role and be a leader who thinks critically, adapts swiftly, and acts ethically because that is who we've prepared you to become. Class of 2025, go forth, discover, learn, and serve. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you, Professor Interagu, for your remarks and encouraging words. Let's give him another round of applause. It is now my great honor, Ed privilege to welcome our chief guest for today. Our chief guest during this 47th graduation ceremony is Ambassador Dennis Awari. Chancellor at the United States International University Africa. Ambassador Aurori is a distinguished leader, seasoned diplomat and accomplished business executive with extensive experience across multiple sectors including mobility, healthcare, renewable energy, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, banking and technical education. His dynamic career spans over four decades, prominently across East Africa and the broader African continent, demonstrating a stefast commitment in innovation, strategic leadership, and sustainable growth. Welcome, Ambassador Aurori. [Applause] The chair of the board of trustees, Professor Eileen. Members of the board of trustees, the chair of the university council, the Paul Casimu, members of the university council, the vice chancellor, Professor Mendan Tarangui, management board, university senate, faculty, students, staff and alumni present, parents and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentle Gentlemen, and most importantly, the graduating class of 2025. Good morning. It is both an honor and a privilege to welcome you to our 47th commencement ceremony, the most significant event in our university calendar for our students. Today we celebrate not only your academic achievements class of 2025 but also your remarkable journey of discovery. This occasion holds a very special meaning for me as it marks my very first commencement ceremony as chancellor of USIU Africa. In the months since my installation, I have learned a great deal about USIU Africa and all of it has thoroughly impressed me and I am humbled by the trust placed in me to serve this great institution and I'm also deeply grateful to share this milestone with you today. I would like to extend a warm welcome and warm and sincere welcome to the distinguished members of the board of trustees and the university council present here today. These remarkable professionals dedicate their expertise, time and wisdom to ensuring the continued success and growth of our beloved institution. Their contributions are an integral part of our collective achievements and we look forward to continuing this journey with them into the future together. To the graduating class of 2025, what a joy it is to witness the culmination of your years of hard work, resilience, and dedication as so aptly described by your validictorian. Your journey has been supported by your professors, mentors, families, and friends. All of whom believed in your potential. Today, we celebrate them as much as we celebrate you. During your time here, you discovered far more than academic knowledge. You discovered new passions, sharpened your talents, and built friendships that will last a lifetime. Among you, as we've just heard, are pioneers in emerging fields. Of great interest to me are the field is the field of sustainability and ESG. You represent a bold response to the most urgent challenges of our of our time. Climate change, environmental degradation, ethical governance, and social equity. Your education has not only equipped you with critical knowledge to tackle these challenges but also instilled a sense of responsibility to play a role in leading Africa, Kenya and the world towards a more just, inclusive and sustainable future. In today's interconnected world, sustainability and ESG are no longer optional. They are the new language of business, governance, and society. Companies and institutions are increasingly judged not just by profit margins. Very important. But not just by profit margins alone, but by their environmental stewardship, social impact, and governance standards. The world is demanding transparency, accountability, and responsibility. You, the class of 2025, step out equipped to participate in turning these global expectations into homegrown solutions that match profitability with purpose. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is transforming how we think and work. As students of USIU Africa, you have learned not to fear AI, but to harness it. AI is not a replacement for human creativity. Instead, it is an accelerator. It can process vast amounts of data, reveal hidden patterns, and automate routine and repetitive tasks. But it cannot replace empathy, wisdom or the human spirit. The leaders of tomorrow, I should say the leaders of today, you will be those who combine the power of these new technologies with ethical decision making and a deep sense of responsibility to society. Some of you explored entrepreneurship through our innovation and incubation center, turning ideas into ventures to serve communities. This puts you firmly on the road to self employment and becoming employers, people who are much needed in our world today. Yet others discovered the balance and teamwork through sports, clubs, and the arts. I saw this firsthand during our inaugural half marathon in July where the power of unity and community came alive to raise funds for the less fortunate among us to be able to join our university. This year's theme of journey of discovery captures the very essence of your USIU Africa experience. You came here with dreams and you leave today not just with degrees but with critical thinking, creativity and ethical leadership. qualities that cannot be replaced by technology, not even by AI at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. These are the skills that will allow you to lead in uncertain times, to adapt quickly, and to make a difference wherever you go. A long time ago, as a young graduate beginning my voyage of discovery, I set out to make a visible impact on every task or job that I undertook with and within a set time by becoming a a a full-time change agent. I implore you to do the same. Being one will help you develop your leadership skills, enhance your career prospects, build networks, foster innovation, and lift your image within your chosen field and beyond. It has worked for me. I haven't always succeeded, but it has worked for me and for many others, and it will work for you, too. Graduation, as you have heard, is not the end of your discovery. It is the beginning of a new chapter. From this day forward, let curiosity guide you. Let courage fuel you and let integrity anchor you. Approach every opportunity and every challenge with the same openness and determination that brought you success here. And remember, as you step out into the world, you do not...",

         "The World Bank's BIG LIE about Nigeria's Economy! (You Need to Hear This)",
         "In this video, we break down the latest praise from the World Bank for President Tinubu's economic reforms. But is this praise justified? A political commentator from Arise News and a fellow content creator argue that the reforms, while praised internationally, are actually causing more hardship for the average Nigerian. They discuss the lack of tangible benefits from the subsidy removal, the continued borrowing, and the truth behind diplomatic statements from organizations like the World Bank.\n​#Nigeria ​#NigerianPolitics ​#Tinubu​#WorldBank ​#SubsidyRemoval​#AtikuAbubakar ​#GoodluckJonathan\n​#AriseNews ​#EconomicReforms​#PoliticalCommentary ​#NigeriaDecides​#APC ​#PDP ​#2027Elections​#NigerianEconomy​#PoliticalWarfare​#TrendingNigeria\nKINDLY SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE POLITICAL UPDATES\nLIKE\nCOMMENT\nSHARE\nSUBSCRIBE",
         "Тексты с изображений\r\nthe world bank*s big че they*re not helping you!)\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:The World Bank can praise Nigerian leader and say the reforms are working here and everything. What do you want the World Bank to say? Is that not what they've always said? Is that not what the Breton institutions always want? They want reforms that will stifle the lives of people. They don't care about the people. What they care about is yes, they lend out the loans to the development partners and the countries involved. And those loans go ahead to hurt those countries in the end and hurt the economy with all sorts of reforms. So they've always pushed for liberalization in the forex market. They got it. They've always pushed for subsidy remover. They got it. But it is us in Nigeria that now know that the World Bank was not correct because this same subsidy remover that the World Bank was going to free up cash for development. We are still now borrowing for development. Till today we can't account for the cash. Some part of the cash that subsidy has freed up is the cash that we are now pling into servicing loans. It's a fact there despite the fact that the government say okay some of the cash they've deployed in some roads but part of that money to is also pushed towards loans. So the question is what was the benefit in the end of removing the subsidies? It brought about hardship but what was the reinvestment in the lives of the people? Next to nothing. There's not been cushioning of the effect of this pain and suffering. All the things President Inobu promised oh agricultural expansion loans for businesses and all of that. It's not been far reaching enough. And that's why when you look at it people are still complaining. a lawyer now has not summoned them via FOI to provide the 8 something million people they said they giving conditional cash for 25,000 we would like to see the number because if you give that money at least we should be able to feel it in the state of of the economy but we can't feel it and it also goes to the conversation about the world bank is they having and they're talking about the fact that yes oh h the the renewed hope um program what initiative I want to do all these things are good but you see there's a difference between announcement and implementation somebody sent me a message yesterday Giovanni Williams about how development bank of Nigeria how they went through the court of development bank in 2019 they said they have money for them till today they have not given them the money so there's a lot of audio announcement till today this government has not investigated what happened in the humanitarian ministry in the last administration under madame far how they were sharing money for people in the hands during covid and they call cash transfer so there are many things it's not just announcement we need to be able to see the implementation and as regards the oil sector it shows people are diverting to the deeper waters but my very good friend and brother says I should wrap up so I wrap Are you the floor? All right, are are you saying the poor countries can never repay their loans? Senator, are are you saying that you're opposed to debt relief for impoverished countries? Yes. No, we should forgive the debts, but that's not going to help those countries very much. Okay. What will tax cuts? Some African tax rates are the highest in the world. In Tanzania, the 30% rate kicks in at $475 of income. Plus, they have a 20% value added tax that gets added to everything you buy. those those high tax rates make it impossible to build capital in those countries. So nothing gets built, not not factories, not roads, not anything. Poor African countries have the lowest wage workers in the world. And yet a company like Nike, for instance, can't can't put a factory in one of those countries because of the oppressive tax rates. Taxes have killed any possibility of economic development. They killed any hope of these countries ever helping themselves, helping themselves. And which that and that leaves them completely at the mercy of charity and loans. And here here's the worst part. You know why those countries have such high tax rates? Because of us to show us that they can raise enough money to pay back their loans, but taxes can't raise any money if they kill the economies. So it turns out that the the tragic unintended consequence of our good our good intentions toward Africa, our kindness, is that we have encouraged those countries to lock themselves into a gruesome economic depression. If we don't urge those countries to cut their tax rates, they will never grow their economies. People will live lifetimes of unemployment. Disease will be rampant. Poverty will be permanent. And children will be hungry. And our charity will never be enough. Never. You see political tensions boy knows that the force in 2027. He himself know the force. Even he is a political grandmaster political strategist. He have he is panic is serious panic in Tobu himself knows you can't he can't deny it and he can't even stand the force in 2027. All effort is to dislodge him from Assur. That is it. Anyways, you know a lot of things are going on. Political leaders are meeting here and there. ADC having their meetings. They are still talking about going through primaries and whoever wins a marriage at that primaries they are all going to support him. A lot of visit here and there. All the political leaders meetings Jonathan we don't know what he's playing at yet. There is still time for all this for them to do everything because everything we are all saying today is still speculations. We are still speculating. Could it be this? Could it be that? Is this one running? Is that one running? Where is it? Which platform is this person running? Is Jonathan on the race? Yes or no? Or is still room speculations because they have not come officially? They have not issued statement officially for us to know for people to know where they stand. Do you understand? And every little meeting you see now is some even if it just personal meetings just to still people will say generalize is politics they are still discussing politics even if they do not even talk about politics in that meetings but hey it is a political season the planning starts now anyways take your time listen to this video as for what bank listen to what he said that's why I like this this man you tell them this truth is bitter but you have to say it the way it is take your time listen to this video we'll come back and talk about it. Don't forget to leave your honest opinion, like, share, comment, and subscribe to this YouTube channel so that you get to see updates like this. Do you understand? Thank you very much. You had you know, President Good Luck Jonathan uh visiting the same senator David M whose uh position as chairman of the party, the ADC has been approved by even if there is a group within the ADC that is objecting to that. Now it's of interest to the extent that one uh in the case of uh Adamawa he disclosed that oh they they met to discuss uh something of interest to the Nigerian people and that we address how the oligarchs in Nigeria are punishing the poor people. So in that regard the disclosure uh was made in that direction but as for president Jonathan people were saying oh okay he's now doing consultations with a lot of people. Well, the reason why many uh commentators would say that was that after President Jonathan left office, he set up the Glo Jonathan Foundation and then he he was very busy with international engagements. Uh he wasn't so actively seen having political meetings. But in recent times, we've seen him having meetings with Mr. Peter B, General Abanga, um uh Governor Baral Muhammad of Bouchi state and then now he was seen publicly going to visit uh Senator David M. He may have visited people previously but you know it didn't generate news but it gets reported now because of the circumstances uh surrounding his uh uh uh his place in the current politics with a lot of people saying that oh he's probably the best uh person uh that can take power away from the APC government and return it to whatever party. But all of that is still at the level of people speculating and trying to do their own permutations. President Jonathan himself has not made any uh any statement as to where he stands. uh it could just well be you know uh uh you know that that he has returned to active politics without necessarily being interested in any position. So we should wait for him uh and not speculate uh for him to come forward and tell us. After all in 2023 some persons went and spent spent 150 million NRA to collect funds on his behalf. At the end of the day uh he said he was not interested. So I think the owners rest with him uh to give clarity. But what we can say is that with all these meetings, with all these consultations, that something is happening that the opposition coalition is coming together trying to find direction. And it is of interest that Malami Abdullah also said yesterday that those members of the coalition who have not made up their minds should go and resign their membership of other political parties and join the opposition coalition under the umbrella of ADC to form a formidable front. By the same token, he said that uh the involvement with ADA, the other political party called ADA has been laid to rest because ADA was supposed to be the backup, you know, uh uh platform just in case the ADC platform uh proved ineffectual. Uh so we watch developments and I think we'll have clarity one way or the other uh by the first quarter of next year. Now the World Bank chief, new World Bank chief in Nigeria, Dr. Veggis meeting with the minister of national planning and budget and national planning. First, he commended Nigeria's economic reform. He says we are on track. Now that has become very characteristic for World Bank. Every time they are prisoning the Chinub administration that the reforms are well. I assume that World Bank will also be diplo\r\n",

Simply put - we must ALL look straight into the mirror and say 'here we are, it is what it is'\nBottom line: We must be HONEST of WHERE WE ARE as a nation, HOW WE GOT HERE and HOW WE CAN GET OUT OF THIS PLACE\nWHERE ARE WE? : We are in a more dangerous place today than we were yesterday or last week or last month or last year or in 2021, or a dozen years ago.

BUYING A STRONGER WHIP ( suggesting that maybe we JUST need a millitary government, one that is tough, with a no nonsense President_😉)\n2. MERE CHANGING OF RIDERS ( We have changed Presidents, probably the most in the SADC region, we are at number 7 as of today, yet reality is that the more we change, the worse our lives turn out to be_😉)\n3.

'GDP or GNP can't grow to such and such figures in a given period' 😀)\n6. *RE- DEFINING OR RE- CLASSIFYING THE DEAD HORSE as 'LIVING IMPAIRED' ( Failing to admit that the System of governance is not helping an ordinary citizen, but convincing ourselves that since it was adopted from a developed country, it is must be the right one for us 😀)\n7.

For years, America thought it had the monopoly on influence, the money, the muscle, the connections. But India, oh, India just showed up in Africa like a master chess player and made a move that has Washington scratching its head. This ain't just about trade deals. It's about respect. It's about positioning. It's about rewriting the future of global power. And tonight I'm going to break down exactly how India used Africa to outsmart America. Let's dive in. Africa is no longer the forgotten continent in global strategy. It is the stage where the future of power will be decided. For decades, world leaders dismissed Africa as a place of instability, poverty or aid dependency. But if you look closely, you'll see what India saw. A gold mine of opportunity. Not just in terms of natural resources like oil, gas, and rare earth metals, but in its people. Africa is home to the fastest growing population on Earth with a youth demographic larger than any other continent. That's not a burden. That's a workforce, an innovation engine, a consumer base waiting to rise. And when you have a continent filled with raw resources and young minds, whoever earns its trust and builds strong ties today will own the future tomorrow. See, America has long approached Africa with a colonial hangover, treating it as a recipient of aid, a pawn in bigger geopolitical battles or simply as a marketplace for Western products. But India looked at the chessboard differently. India saw Africa not as a charity case but as a partner in progress. That single shift in mindset changes everything. Because when you treat someone as an equal, when you come in with respect and not superiority, you plant the seeds of loyalty that no amount of money can buy. Now, let's talk about the geography and strategy behind it. Africa sits at the crossroads of some of the world's most important shipping lanes. From the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, controlling relationships in Africa means controlling trade routes that connect the East and West. India being historically connected to Africa through centuries of trade and migration already has cultural and human bridges that America doesn't. Indian businesses didn't just show up yesterday. They've been investing in Africa's healthcare and energy for decades. And those long-term commitments, they're paying off right now. While Washington debates budgets and lectures African leaders on democracy, India is building railroads, laying internet cables, training doctors, and setting up solar projects. You think African nations don't notice that? Of course they do. They see who's there to empower and who's there to control. And slowly those hearts and minds shift away from the west and toward New Delhi. This is what makes Africa the new chess board. Every piece on this board, every port, every contract, every diplomatic handshake matters. Endshake matters. And India is moving like a grandmaster, thinking five steps ahead. They're not just making deals, they're securing influence. They're not just selling products. They're shaping futures. America, it still plays checkers assuming brute force or big checks will win the day. But in Africa, that arrogance is backfiring. What we're witnessing is the opening act of a global game where Africa is no longer the background. It is the prize. And India, it just positioned itself as the player who understands the board better than anyone else. For decades, Africa has been treated like a patient in the hospital of global politics. Weak, dependent, waiting for aid packages from the West. America and its allies rolled in with their billions. But those billions always came with fine print. To this, vote that way. Follow our rules. Accept our oversight. Aid became a leash and that leash became resentment. African leaders smiled at the photo ops. But deep down they knew the truth. They weren't being treated as equals. They were being managed. India saw that weakness in America's approach and said, \"Nah, we're not playing that game.\" Instead of aid, India came with something far more powerful. Partnership. But in the m, not pity, not handouts, not lectures. India said, \"Let's build together.\" That's why today you see Indian companies constructing roads in Kenya, laying fiber optic cables in Nigeria and helping with renewable energy projects in Ethiopia. These aren't charity projects. These are investments. When you invest, both sides win. When you give aid with strings, only one side wins and the other side knows it. Think about the psychology here. If I give you money with a list of conditions, you're always looking for a way out of the deep. But if I build a factory with you, if I train your engineers, if I partner with your farmers, you don't just owe me, you trust me. That's the difference between dependency and partnership. And that's exactly the card India played. America still doesn't get Washington wants control, not collaboration. But India understood the power of humility. It approached Africa saying, \"We were colonized, too. We know what it feels like to be underestimated, exploited, written off. Let's rise together. That message hits differently in Africa than America's will help you, but only if you behave. And here's the kicker. This partnership approach isn't just winning friends. It's building long-term influence. When you put down roots in education, infrastructure, and technology, you create ties that no amount of American aid can compete with. A student in Ghana trained by an Indian university will remember who gave him that chance. A community in Tanzania lit up by Indian solar grids won't forget who helped them move from darkness to light. India's smart play is simple but profound. Stop treating Africa like a child and start treating it like a partner. That shift alone changes the balance of global power. Because in the 21st century, influence doesn't come from who gives the biggest check. It comes from who earns the most respect. And right now in Africa, America is writing checks. But India is cashing in trust. So the question isn't whether India outsmarted America. The real question is how long will it take for Washington to realize the game has changed because Africa has made it clear it doesn't want aid. It wants allies and India just became the ally of choice. Quiet revolutions are the most dangerous ones because they grow in silence in the shadows while the big powers are distracted. That's exactly what's happening with bricks. For years, Washington laughed at it. Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, a bunch of countries with different problems, different goals, and supposedly no chance of competing with the mighty G7. But while America laughed, bricks built brick by brick, deal by deal, it became the silent revolution that is now shaking the foundation of the global system. And here's where Africa comes in. Africa isn't just a side story to bricks. It's the bridge. India being one of the key voices inside bricks recognized that Africa could supercharge the group's legitimacy and reach. If BRICS was going to be more than just a talk shop, it needed new blood, new partners, and new markets. Enter Africa, a continent hungry for investment, desperate for allies that don't treat it as secondass, and ready to rewrite its own story. India understood this better than most. China already poured billions into African infrastructure, but often with predatory debt traps. The West offered aid, but with arrogance attached. India's play was subtler. It positioned itself as the friendly face of bricks, the partner that Africans could trust. By doing so, India isn't just helping Africa rise. It's turning Africa into bricks territory, expanding the block's influence in ways America cannot ignore. Now, think about the symbolism here. For decades, the US dollar has been the king of global trade. You wanted to buy oil dollars. You wanted to secure loans, dollars. But BRICS is slowly pushing for alternatives, trading in local currencies, building a development bank, creating systems that bypass Washington's control. And with Africa leaning closer to bricks, that vision starts to look real. Imagine dozens of African countries trading with India and China in their own currencies backed by bricks financial systems. That's not just a shift. It's a revolution. What makes this silent revolution so powerful is that it doesn't announce itself with bombs, threats, or invasions. It grows in quiet contracts and handshake deals and trade agreements signed without headlines. And by the time America notices, it's already too late. That's exactly how India is playing this game. While Washington shouts about democracy and sanctions, New Delhi whispers about opportunity and partnership. And guess which voice Africa listens to. This is why Africa is the pivot. Bricks without Africa is a club. Bricks with Africa, that's a movement. A movement that challenges the dollar, challenges the old world order and gives voice to nations that were always sideline. India saw that potential and grabbed it. It connected bricks vision with African ambition, making itself the bridge not just between continents but between the future and the past. So when people say bricks is just a a talking shop, I laugh because in silence this revolution is building power. And India through Africa just positioned itself as the architect of that new world. America better wake up because while it's busy clinging to old power, a new system is being written right under its nose. Power makes you comfortable and comfort makes you blind. That right there is America's problem in the 21st century. For decades, the United States strutdded around the global stage with the confidence of a heavyweight champion who thought the belt would always be his. But here's the truth. If you stop training, if you stop adapting, someone younger, hungrier, and smarter is going to come for that belt. And in Africa, America's arrogance just opened the door for India to step in. Let's be honest, Washington didn't lose Africa because it lacked money or influence. It lost because it assumed dominance was permanent. US leaders acted like Africans had no choice but to take whatever was offered. Aid, loans, military presence. But times have changed. Africa doesn't want to be managed. It wants to be respected. And America never adjusted to that reality. It kept running the same playbook from the cold war talking about influence and e control while India rewrote the rules of the game. India came in humble. It came in listening. It came in saying, \"Oh, we know what it feels like to be pushed around by global powers. Let's rise together.\" That humility, that's not weakness. That's strategy. Because humility builds trust, and trust builds power. America didn't see that. Washington still thinks that throwing billions of dollars around is enough to secure loyalty. But money without respect is empty. It buys temporary compliance, not lasting partnership. Look at it like this. If you've got a friend who only calls you when they need something, how long before you stop picking up the phone? That's how Africa feels about America. But India, India showed up not just when it needed something, but when Africa needed something. Hospitals at training, renewable energy. India met Africa where it was, not where it wanted Africa to be. That difference turned into a weapon more powerful than any aircraft carrier or military base. And let me tell you, arrogance always backfires. America thought it could lecture nations into obedience. Instead, it drove them into the arms of new partners. It thought it could isolate bricks. Instead, it fueled its growth. It thought it alone would guaranteed loyalty. Loyalty. Instead, it exposed its own weakness. The blind spot wasn't money. It was mindset. America assumed the world would never change. India assumed the opposite and adapted. This is the lesson. Survival belongs to those who evolve. America had the muscle, but India had the mindset. Whoa. And on the battlefield of influence, mindset beats muscle every single time. If Washington doesn't learn that lesson, it's going to keep losing ground. Not just in Africa, but everywhere. Because the game has changed. Respect is the new currency. Adaptation is the new power. And humility, yes, humility is the weapon of the future. India figured it out. America hasn't. And until it does, it's going to keep getting outplayed one partnership at a time. We are living through a moment of awakening and most people don't even realize it yet. For decades, the world moved on autopilot. America sets the rules everybody else follows. But that era, it's cracking piece by piece right in front of our eye and Africa with India as its unexpected partner. Just send a message to the whole planet. The future belongs to those who respect, not those who dominate. This awakening isn't just about Africa or India. It's about a shift in the very definition of power. In the old world, power was measured in bombs and bases and bank accounts. But in the new world, power is measured in trust and respect and collaboration. And let me tell you, when a nation earns trust, it's stronger than when it commands fear. Fear fades. Respect last. That's the awakening America has been too slow to see. Think about it. Africa doesn't need handouts anymore. It needs allies to unlock its own potential. It doesn't need lectures. It needs partnerships. India saw that before anyone else and moved in not with arrogance but with humility. And by doing so, it didn't just gain influence, it reshaped the game. Now African nations are looking at New Delhi and saying, \"Here's a partner who understands.\" That changes everything. And here's where the future gets real. This awakening isn't limited to Africa. It's spreading. Countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, they're all asking the same question. Why do we have to play by America's rules? If India can step into Africa and build trust, then maybe Brazil can do it in South America. Maybe China can expand in Asia. Maybe smaller nations can finally punch above their weight. That's what scares Washington. Not the loss of one deal or one alliance, but the possibility that respectdriven partnerships will replace feard-driven dominance everywhere. For the average person watching this, let me break it down. The awakening means your world is about to change. The prices you pay, the alliances your country keeps, the news you hear every night. It's all going to shift as new powers rise and old powers fade. And guess what? You can't stop it. You can only choose whether to adapt to it. India just proved that strategy beats swagger, respect beats arrogance, and listening beats lecturing. That lesson isn't just for nations. It's for all of us. Because in your own life, the same principle applies. If you want loyalty, don't demand it, earn it. If you want influence, don't force it, build it. That's how you create something lasting. That's how you lead. So, what does this mean for the future? It means the monopoly is over. The game is wide open. Africa isn't waiting for permission anymore. India isn't asking for recognition anymore. And America, well, America has a choice. Wake up and adapt or keep clinging to the past until it's left behind. The awakening is here. The only question is who's ready for it? And there you have it. Africa isn't just a backdrop anymore. It's the front line of the new world order. India saw it, moved in with respect and rewrote the rules of the game while America was still busy patting itself on the back. This is bigger than trade deals, bigger than politics. This is about the future of power itself. The lesson is clear in this century. Respect is the currency. Humility is the strategy and partnership is the weapon. Those who adapt will rise and those who cling to arrogance will fall. So, as we watch India and Africa write a new chapter together, the question for America and for all of us is simple. Are we ready to wake up? To adapt, to adapt, to lead with respect instead of dominance? Because the awakening isn't coming someday. It's already here. And only the nations and the people who recognize it will own the future.\r\n",

         "🇿🇲 EXPLAINER | Zambia’s 2026 Budget: Big Numbers, Big Questions\nFinance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane tabled a K253.1 billion national budget for 2026, equal to 27.4 percent of GDP. It is the largest in Zambia’s history and the most domestically mobilized: K206.5 billion will come from tax revenue, with K12.1 billion from grants and K34.5 billion from borrowing. For the first time, Zambia is funding four-fifths of its spending from within. But behind the headline is a story of constraints.\nWhat Domestic Mobilization Means\nDomestic resource mobilization refers to how much of the budget government raises from taxes and local non-tax revenues rather than borrowing or aid. In Zambia’s case, 82 percent of the 2026 budget will be financed by domestic revenue. This is a historic level. It means less dependence on donors and external creditors, and more sovereignty in setting national priorities. But it also means the burden of taxation falls squarely on citizens and businesses. Every kwacha collected through VAT, PAYE, mining royalties, and corporate tax is what will drive schools, hospitals, and roads.\nWhy It Matters\nHigh domestic mobilization is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it signals fiscal maturity. Countries that raise their own revenue are less vulnerable to donor conditions and foreign shocks. On the other hand, in a fragile economy, heavy domestic taxation risks choking consumption and squeezing small businesses. The IMF has praised Zambia for widening its tax net, but many traders in markets or SMEs feel they are being taxed into the ground while service delivery remains patchy.\nDebt Still Heavy\nDebt service is the single largest item, consuming K73.6 billion. K52 billion goes to domestic repayments and K21.7 billion to external creditors. That is more than one third of the budget. Even after restructuring 94 percent of external debt, costly Treasury bills and bonds issued between 2015 and 2021 now falling due are leaving little room for fresh investment. This is the fiscal iron wall government cannot ignore.\nConstituency Development Fund (CDF)\nThe CDF has been raised from K36.1 million to K40 million per constituency, bringing the total envelope to K6.2 billion. Since 2022, the fund has delivered 2,800 classrooms and 131 health posts. But the allocation formula remains flat. Lusaka Central, with 150,000 voters, still receives the same as remote areas with 30,000. Without reform to factor population and poverty, the increase risks deepening inequality rather than fixing it.\nEnergy: The Elephant in the Room\nA new K500 million Electricity Fund has been introduced, including the Zambia–Tanzania interconnector and a five megawatt thermal plant in Lusaka. But the gap is vast. Drought cut hydro output by 40 percent, creating a shortfall of nearly 1,000 megawatts. Emergency imports are draining the treasury while exports continue under regional contracts. This contradiction fuels public anger. The fix is transparency. Publish quarterly data on imports, exports, and net balances. Without that, the public will see policy as spin, not substance.\nSocial Protection\nSocial protection has been allocated K15.7 billion, or 6.2 percent of the budget. Of this, K7.65 billion goes to the Social Cash Transfer, K1.03 billion to Cash-for-Work, and K1.5 billion to the Food Security Pack. Transfers remain unchanged at K800 per household and K1,200 for households with disabilities. The challenge is timeliness. If payments are delayed, the cushion collapses. Cash-for-Work in particular must evolve into a skills and employment ladder, not just temporary relief.\nEducation and Health\nEducation continues to dominate. Free education now covers 2.3 million children. Recruitment of 3,500 teachers and bursaries for 6,000 students is planned for 2026. Since 2022, over 28,000 students have benefited. But quality will depend on matching classrooms with teachers and timely funding. Health receives K6.4 billion for medicines and K953 million for equipment, alongside five new hospitals. After shortages in 2024 and 2025, this allocation responds to pressure, but the real test is whether drugs are consistently available on pharmacy shelves.\nAgriculture Push\nAgriculture has been given K15.5 billion, with K9.15 billion for the Farmer Input Support Programme, now expanded to all 116 districts. K2.1 billion is set aside for Strategic Food Reserves. Irrigation, veterinary services, and new drought-resistant seed projects are on the table. The ambition is bold: 10 million tonnes of maize, and one million tonnes each of wheat and soya by 2031. If logistics and trade policy lag, surplus risks turning into waste.\nElections and Governance\nThe 2026 general elections are budgeted at K1.19 billion. Unless ring-fenced, this will crowd out health and education spending. On governance, amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act and a new Medium-Term Revenue Strategy have been promised. These are important, but credibility will depend on whether political will holds during the campaign season.\nThe Bottom Line\nThis is Zambia’s biggest and most domestically financed budget yet. It signals fiscal strength but also exposes the risk of over-taxing a fragile economy. The weight of debt, the fragility of energy, and the rising cost of an election year leave little room for error. For ordinary citizens, the question is simple: will 2026 bring more power in their homes, more food on their tables, and more medicine in their clinics?\n📩 Readers are invited to share their thoughts with us at editor.peoplesbrief@gmail.com",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nbreaking news! angola joins burkina faso*s revolution!\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Angola has just dropped a bombshell that's got the blood suckers of our resources. Those western corporations and their local lackey shaking in their stolen suits. Angola's announced its Kabinda oil refinery, the first since independence in 1975, will start pumping fuel by December 2025. This isn't just about refining oil. It's a full-on revolt against centuries of exploitation. A bold stand alongside Burkina Faso, Marley and Niger who are snatching back their gold, uranium and more. The looters are losing sleep because Angola's done playing their game. From Kabinda's crude to Zambia's pumps, this is the dawn of a new Africa. One where we process our own minerals, trade with our brothers, and build a future where the people, not the parasites, feast on our riches. Let's break it down raw and real. Because this is the Panaffrican uprising we've been praying for. Angola's a giant, sitting on enough oil to make the world jealous. 1.2 million barrels a day, second only to Nigeria in subsahara and Africa. But for decades, they've been robbed blind. Picture this. 98% of their crude shipped raw to Europe or Asia only to buy back refined diesel and jet fuel at prices that would make your ancestors weep. Right now, Angola imports 72% of its fuel, 3.3 million metric tonses a year, burning billions, while folks in Lwanda and Benuela quue for gas. Last year's subsidy cuts meant to save cash sparked riots that left 22 dead in July 2024. It's the same old neoc colonial scam, extract export impoverish. But the Cababinda refinery, a 30,000 barrel per day beast in the oil richch north, is flipping the script. Oil Minister Diamantino Azido dropped the news like a grenade. By year's end 2025, this $500 million project, majority owned by local investors via Gem Corp with Sonangal's 10% stake, will churn diesel, jet fuel, and NAFTA. What's this mean for the people? Everything. Cheaper fuel cuts transport costs so food doesn't cost an arm and a leg in a country where 40% live on less than $2 a day. Subsidies that drained $2 billion last year can fade without sparking more protests, freeing up cash for hospitals in Hambo, schools in Milan, roads in Moxico. Jobs over 2,800 workers, 85% Angolan, are already on site. From welders in Kabinda to engineers in Lwanda, building skills that stay home, not siphoned to London or Lisbon. Angola's not stopping here. Phase 2 doubles output to 60,000 barrels per day. and new refineries are planned for soyo and libidito. By 2030, they could cover half their fuel needs and even export surplus. This isn't just self-sufficiency. It's Angola stepping up as a southern African energy hub. Now, here's where it gets wild. Angola's not keeping this fire to itself. They're passing the torch to their African kin. Zambia, the copper king next door, is in advanced talks to import Angolan fuel, slashing costs by ditching Persian Gulf tankers. At a Lusaka forum in July, energy director Rodney Kota laid it out. Deals are nearly done with a Libito Lusaka pipeline in the works. Zambia's got a 26% stake in the LibO refinery set to fire up by 2026. President Hackinda Hitchima said it clear in 2023. Why haul oil from halfway across the world when our neighbors got it? This could drop Zambia's fuel prices by 20 to 30%, easing the quaar's strain and boosting copper belt mines. It's African trade done right. Short routes, low emissions, no western middlemen skimming profits. President Jo Lorenzo put it plain. Zambia wants our fuel. It's natural. We've got the muscle. From Lwanda to Lusaka, this is pan-Africanism in pipelines, not just talk. Zoom out and you'll see Angola's move is part of a bigger blaze. Bikina Faso, Mali and Niger, the alliance of Sahel states, AEN formed in 2023 after cutting ties with Akawaz and French puppeteers are leading the charge. Burkina under Captain Ibrahim Trareay kicked off their Marina gold refinery in November 2023. By late 2024, it's processing 150 tons a year. Africa's fourth biggest gold producer, keeping its wealth home. Before Trail Ray, they shipped raw doray bars to Switzerland for $300 an ounce. Now, 99% pure bars fetch $1,200 with $18 billion in revenue since 2022. Nationalized mines like Bongu and Wagnyon snatched from Canadians for $80 million boosted state stakes to 20%. Jobs 100 direct, 5,000 indirect, empowering women who once panned rivers for scraps. Marley's on the same wave. Their 2023 mining code mandates 10% state equity with an option for 20% more. They took Gangoto mine from Allied gold, handing it to the state. Gold, cotton, bork site, once France's cash cow, now fuel Bamako's rise. Niga, with 5% of the world's uranium, kicked France's Arano out of Sare, taking full control. Copper licenses now go to locals. Rare earths are eyed for batteries. The AES is more than a pact. It's mutual defense, a joint parliament by 2026, and a confederate bank to fund roads and grids without IMF chains. Trayore said it best. We're mining it ourselves. From jihadist shadows to sovereign strength, the Sahel's setting the pace. This is the new Africa, my people. A continent sick of being the world's raw material pit stop. Angola's Kabinda, Bikina's gold, Marley's mines, Niger's uranium. It's one fight. Process at home. Trade with kin. Build our own. African leaders wake up. Ghana's starting gold refining this year. Tanzania banned raw ore exports. Why ship DRC's lithium to China when Kaggali could refine it? Why Niger's uranium to France when Naomi needs power? Africa's got $2 trillion in annual mineral wealth. Cobalt, colan, oil, gold. Refine it, build with it, trade it. South South and we'd outshine the global north. No more $2 trillion in illicit flows to tax havens. No more begging for loans with strings. Before we continue, brothers and sisters, as the UN General Assembly continues, let's listen to the bold speech of Angola President at the UN. Your Excellency the President of the General Assembly, Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen. I stand before your excellencies in my capacity as president of the Republic of Angola and the current chairperson of the African Union to speak about my country to share our perspective on the evolution of the events unfolding in these increasingly troubled world and to discuss matters concerning Africa, a continent that mobilizes our energies and efforts as we seek solutions to finally awake it once for all towards development. Allow me to extend my congratulations to her excellency Anal Burbach on her election to the distinguished office of president of the United Nations General Assembly. convinced that her experience and the knowledge she has accumulated through the various functions she has performed with great mastery will ensure the success of the work she has taken on since the beginning of this month of September. I also would like to congratulate her predecessor, his excellency Filimon, for the assertive manner in which he precided over the general assembly during the past year, having devoted his utmost dedication to ensuring that this body should operate with commendable efficiency, a fact that rightfully deserves our collective recognition in light of the positive outcomes achieved throughout his tenure. I cannot fail to acknowledge his excellency Antonio Gutirez, Secretary General of United Nations for the role that he has so ely played with a profound sense of commitment underpinned by his admirable qualities as a man of dialogue and peace amid prevailing geopolitical complexities. Madame President, excellencies, 80 years have elapsed since compelled by imperatives of that era, a group of nations and their respective leaders took the wise decision to establish the United Nations organization which from that moment through both turbulent and peaceful instances had succeeded in fulfilling its great mission of maintaining ing the global peace and stability contributing to the advancement of humanity and to preserve and deepen respect for human rights. This is a great achievement of the peoples of our planet which cannot and must not be neglected and underestimated by any power, political leaders or by anyone lest by magnifying egocentric visions and interests. We forfeit the benefits of peace bequith to us by women and men who over time led us so far in an environment of harmony and global understanding. This journey has not always been linear. Yet in the most critical moments, prudence has prevailed over the worst impulses of large scale conflict. And this has been possible solely through continual dialogue, which has proven to be the only factor capable of bridging differences, overcoming obstacles, and appeasing even the most troubled and belligerent spirits. Today, these lessons from the past are of a great value and must serve as our sole references that guide us toward solution to the conflicts in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, in Asia, and wherever they may arise. Under the context of uncertainty in which we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, the theme better together 80 years and beyond for peace, development and human rights holds a significance that compels us to reflect upon the profound meaning of the appeal by her excellency the president of general assembly for the renewal of M literally ism and solidarity in action within a framework of collective and complimentary undertakings by a more agile, effective and responsible UN as invisited in the road map of the secretary general's initiative 80. In light of these perspectives, it is urgent that we revitalize the United Nations and lift it from the complex situation in which it find itself currently in order to restore the active role that he has always played. a strongly valuable role that during the cold war gave us assurance of never feeling as close to a global conflict as we do at this moment amid the profound distance prevailing in international relations. The main world powers appear to be turning their backs on one another, distancing themselves from even the most basic points of convergence that would allow them to remain committed to above all to the dialogue and concerted action. Today's challenges confront us with a choice. Either to do everything in our power to preserve peace or to face war with all its consequences, thus jeopardizing the future of humanity. Those were powers that in the past played a crucial role in the liberation of Europe and its people from the clutches of nism and fascism as well as in the liberation of Africa and its people from the apath regime in South Africa. cannot today act differently by aggressing other countries, invading and nexing foreign territories, nor by financing or organizing upheavalss that could cause the to the overthrow of legitimate governments as we currently witness in our own continent. With this dangerous president, no regional, continent or global institution will henceforth have the moral authority to call to to call any state to reason when it breaches the principles that govern the UN charter and international law. We Africans from countries that endured centuries of colonization perhaps understand better than anyone else the importance of peace. For we have had to face daily struggles to provide our people with food, clean water, health care, education and other fundamental necessities. This experience engenders heightened sensitivity to the harmful impact of that insecurity and instability have on the attainment of our goals and developmental projects. This reality is further exeated by numerous conflicts and wars afflicting countries and regions across the globe from which we had hoped to find cooperation and fruitful exchanges so that together we might overcome our difficulties and contribute with our immense resources and capabilities to global prosperity. It is upon this foundation that the Republic of Angola has sought to make an earnest and genuine contribution to resolving the conflict in the Sahel region in Sudan and in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo regarding which our efforts established a negotiation framework with P solution that regrettably did not come to fruition in December 2024 as anticipated, but nonetheless remains a the valid platform for further efforts being undertaken with the aim of bringing a definitive end to that conflict. Madame President, excellencies, that conflict and so many others that we recall are to a large extent the result of pacivity of the United Nations member states who have often revealed themselves to be ineffective in the face of invasion of third party territories and interference in internal affairs of sovereign countries that uh occurred over the recent years and have not provoked a firm, resolute and assertive reaction. Therefore, have become fitter comply that lie at the very center of the major tensions that the world is currently experiencing. The consequences of these are very evident before our eyes in the Middle East where the systematic failure to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolution regarding the creation of the state of Palestine has perpetuated a conflict that worsens with each day passing and appears to have no end in sight. in face of disproportionate and violent response and viol and retaliation by Israel which while having a right to exist as a state and to demand the release of those still held hostage from the tragic events of October 7th must not however be allowed to pursue in Palestine and particularly in the Gaza Strip a policy of extermination of a whole people. The Palestinian people who must not be conflated with Hamus for there is no peoples and certainly no children who are terrorist has precisely the same right to an independent sovereign state where they may assert their culture safeguard for the future and provide predictable and secure prospect for their youth. The concern surrounding that conflict grew ever more severely in the face of silence, hesitations and teamed response of the international community which seems to legitimize the expansion of war to other countries in the region inexably corroding the authority of the United Nations. There is nothing more serious than the exclusion of the delegation of Palestine from this forum where it should rightly have the opportunity to make its voice heard as member state in accordance with the terms of the host agreement. The failure to guarantee the presence of the present of the Palestinian Authority at this general assembly sends a profoundly negative signal as it encourages the continuation of genocide. We all are witnessing helplessly and with impunity which delays the resolution of the issue and complicates the efforts that have been made to bring an end to that intricate conflict. We strongly condemn this unilateral position which is contrary to the principles that govern the United Nations even as we urge unconditional lifting of the unjust and prolonged embargo against Cuba which has dire consequences for the economy and the living conditions of the Cuban people who struggle daily to withstand a punishment rejected by the international community as a Cuba which played an important role in the struggle of African peoples leading to the overthrow of the racist and inhuman apathide regime in South Africa and by virtue of these was a signary to the New York peace accord of December 22nd 1988 which brought freedom to the South African people and led to the independence of Namibia cannot be arbitrarily and unilaterally considered a state of terrorism in light of the relevant United Nation resolutions. This model of conduct by a small group of countries which does not conform to the even minimum acceptable standards of global coexistence is at the root of the unilateral and subjective sanctions imposed also on Zimbabwe and Venezuela. measures that produce no other results other than the suffering of population who in an act of great patriotism ultimately unite themselves in the defense of their nations. Madame President, excellencies, the authority of this organization whose foundation is the UN charter and international law must be urgently restored without narratives that highlight a logic of double standards. so that just solutions may be sought for the war in Ukraine or so that solutions proposed by the meeting held in Alaska may be reinforced. Ukraine being a European country after President Trump met with President Putin on a pragmatic manner and without prejudice to the need for direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine, one would expect that European leaders in an interest of Europe's peace and security would likewise seek direct dialogue not only with the President Zilinski but also with President than Putin. We cannot afford to squander this opportunity for otherwise we risk witnessing an escalation of unpredictable proportions and consequences not only in Europe where all active stakeholder must abandon the pillarist calculation rooted in the notion of military victory through the witnessing of adversaries capabilities. Is it is in the light of face of the present challenges and the ongoing global crisis that the United Nations must rem emerge and become more proactive lest its role as the main entity for global governments be diminished and be transformed into an institution incapable of ensuring world peace. Therefore, it is our responsibility as states and sovereign nations not to allow the UN to succumb. The United Nations in its present form is the sole organization with capacity to act on behalf of all of us in the quest for worldwide consensus in favor of peace with the legitimacy to call to reason those member states who undermine its foundational principles in their conduct on the international stage. For this reason, we must preserve it at all cost and adapt it to the realities of the contemporary world through the agently required reforms. In this most particular regard, I advocate for the reform of the security council in line with common African position set forth in the esolene consensus and in the third declaration adopted 20 years ago which called for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats for the African continent in an expanded security council that is more representative and consistent with the contemporary geopolitical realities. Without this industable state tape which has already experienced an unjustified delay, we will not be able to ensure the realization of the pact for the future adopted last year which recognized the urgent need to endow the United Nations with a more democratic and balanced security council. This pact represents a significant opportunity to revitalize multilateralism, rendering it more inclusive and capable of serving as a broader foundation for discussion on critical issues facing today's world. Amongst these I wish to underscore alongside many other relevant issues the issue of financing for development and climate challenge with regard to matters concerning support for development. There remains much to be discussed but also it's appropriate to recognize the recent progress achieved with the adoption of the severe commitment reached at the fourth conference on financing for development which advocates the urgent reform of international financial institutions so as to render them more representative, inclusive and equipped to address the pressing needs of the developing countries, especially those of Africa. I am convinced that this instrument combined with a pact for the future, the United Nation fiscal convention and the United Nation debt convention, steel and discussion will together serve as a political, financial and normative platform that will provide significant momentum to the achievement of the sustainable able development goals. Madame President, excellencies, it is essential that we confront the climate crisis as the greatest existential threat of our time, which can only be overcome through joint, coordinated, and united action. In view of the ongoing increase of global warming and the increasingly violent frequent natural res disasters, it has become imperative that the nations that which derived the greatest benefits from industrial and economic development in the past fully assumed today the historical responsibility ensuring as an act of climate justice, adequate financing, technology, G transfer and support for adaptation and mitigation for the developing countries. The countries with only residuals share in greenhouse gas emissions are those that disproportionately and virtually alone face the impact of climate change, global warming and the devastating effects on agriculture, food security and public health. In view of such evidence and the responsibilities arising there from Angola remains steadfastly committed to the Paris agreement and to the implementing adaptation and mitigation measures in an alignment with the United Nations 2030 agenda and the African Union 2063 agenda which enshrine the consensus concerning the mobilization of predictable affordable climate financing intended to ensure a just energy transition capable of protecting the most vulnerable communities. This crosscutting theme which demands increasingly heightened sense of responsibility both within the scope of public agendas and among major industrial corporations will receive due attention at the forthcoming COP 30 climate summit to be held shortly in Brazil which for the second time hosts an event of this magnitude. a testament to the country's commitment and engagement with environmental issues. In 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was inaugurated. A paradigm that has proven greatly beneficial through increasingly profound discussion that endured to this day and which will assuredly at the forthcoming conference enable us all to take another step forward on this long journey that we must undertake to achieve the major climate goals aspired by humanity. Excellencies 80 years after the founding of the United Nations and following the end of the cold war, our expectation was that we would be living in the world without present uncertainties and not as pelas as that which we now witness. Until 1991, we lived in a context marked by sharp division between two ideologically opposed blocks, which nevertheless offered a more predictable framework and was less susceptible to drifting into large scale confrontation. This flashback should not lead us to the conclusion that the global stability is only possible within a framework of rigid divisions of any kind. Rather, it should inspire us to build a system based on balanced interest and shared concern on matters pertaining to global security that fosters complimentarity and all forms of convergence within an environment of multilateralism which remains the sole pathway capable of preserving us from a true catastrophe. With these few words, I thank you for your kind attention. On behalf of the assembly, I wish to Angola's Kabinda refinery is more than steel and oil. It's a beacon of Africa's awakening alongside Bkina Faso, Maralley, and Niger. Angola is seizing its mineral wealth, breaking the chains of neocolonial theft. From fueling its people to powering Zambia's minds. This is pan-African unity in action. Processing at home, trading with brothers, building our future. The looters tremble because they see it. When Africa controls its riches, it controls its destiny. Let every leader heed this call. Refine our gold, our oil, our lithium, and watch the motherland rise as a global powerhouse. Umo Ninguvu. Unity is strength. The new Africa is here and it's unstoppable.\r\n",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:[Music] I thought if I did everything right, we'd never argue. I thought being perfect meant never needing help. But love is not in the flawless. It's in the trying, the forgiving, and the mess. This is perfect imperfections, unfiltered, unfinished, unapologetically human. Welcome back to Fire and Spice podcast. I hope you had your drink. Mhm. You you quenched the thirst. He came for us today, but I'm about to come for him. Mhm. Serious conversations. These are even more serious conversation. Mhm. Fireflies. [Music] I'm a firefree spices. Choose one. Whatever you want to be called. Haters. Haters. Spice people. spices. Hey any not even like maybe two episodes ago that when someone really wants to spend time with you they will create time. Yes. They will always create time. Mhm. And then you're out here telling us people are busy with their stuff. They just don't meet like more often like for social. They meet for business. For example, they meet for business. Is that why you we like I am busy. You are busy. Amen. You're welcome for my contribution. And you're doing a good job, right? What spice, right? Fire. Yeah. Why is there a conundrum? I don't know. People have been calling me fire. Do I look spicy? Maybe your hair [Music] after the break. What were we talking before we went for the break? cuz now I'm feeling like every episode has us thinking [Music] 10 episodes in. I hope you all feel the way I feel like we have room for growth as human beings. I've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from from ourselves. I didn't think we had this many points. Did we even have a And from hearing from you guys eye opener. Yeah. An eye opener. And today we're dealing with the topic of success. So yeah, by the way success on a simple on a simple definition. Mhm. A success is just achievement of your goal like and then when you achieve them become successful. As simple as that. So depending on your goals, I was giving these examples here. You have that maybe money but you don't have those people. M that is why they say it's it's lonely there at the top you don't have those people yes they create time for you and when they create time for you is not the social life is time either for business or family for a reason not just to have And that was what I was trying to say. Like we would meet when we are down there, we would meet for no reason because we And that is the difference now. Now when you do that mhm and that is why I said poverty mashida they unite people they bring people everybody can relate on some level. Everybody can relate with this poverty with this easy mashida where you with these struggles everybody can relate to. So it unites people. I can relate to you can relate to me. We form a group. Yeah. So that is what I was trying to say. But just because I am successful doesn't mean I change. But you did change. It's just that I cannot deal with your change. What changed? the way you carry yourself. I don't think it's cuz you just said you meet now with people for a purpose. That's change. So me maybe I'm the change is not intentional. It is intentional. It's it's it's the level that I am in brings that brings the change. It is intentional. Okay. The problem is I am refusing to accommodate your change. Uh-huh. Yes. Let me let me probably dig myself a very deep hole and take this to a to another whole kind of different topic. Mhm. So, I think I think we're talking about the drunk and whatever. Oh, yeah. So success is when we achieve our goal. Whatever your goal is. What if the the success is me healing or me disconnecting myself from the dysfunction of even poverty on some level is a dysfunction. It's it's something that I don't want to nobody wants to live in poverty. So what if my goal is to pull myself from this situation, right? So my goal is to heal, to disconnect myself from poverty, from dysfunction, from toxicity, from all this thing. The achievement of my goal is change. Then what am I going to do with you now? Now you have to find a way to deal with that side of me. And it is very hard when you're not broken. And that is how we separate because you don't know me. You cannot handle me on that side. You only knew to handle me on the other side. But this side of me you cannot handle. Then that is how we separate. Or I don't know how to. That is how we separate. And it's okay. That is okay. It feels like a lot of separation in this thing. It is. It is. Uhhuh. If we used to know I will call you right now. I cannot. In fact, I cannot relate as much as you want. I don't drink anymore. Maybe change. So you don't know how to handle the sober me. So yeah, you don't know how to handle, you know, there's like a whole movement of that, right? Oh yeah. So the sober me but it is you who just but the sober you doesn't want to hang out with me then follow me but I don't want to be sober. That is when separation comes. There's a lot of separation. That is where separations come because anymore cuz I don't drink anymore. You cannot call me. Then you cannot relate. I cannot you cannot relate with me because where you hang out is not where I hang out. And you don't want to come to where I hang out because maybe it's boring. I don't want to come to where you hang out because it's too noisy. So, we separate. And it is okay. Is it? Yeah, it is okay. I get what you mean by it's okay. Mhm. I actually understand. Mhm. But it sounds like life in itself is a whole bunch of separations. Growth. Growth. Then there's a problem. There's always going to be Oh, yeah. There's always there's always a place for you. This is what I'm trying to say. These separations, they happen every time. How do you see Maringo? No, that is what I said before we went for a break. Mhm. Because you cannot handle me there. I don't have to deem my lights to fit in your company. But it still it still feels bad when you know that familiar thing where you have this friends, there's relationships that you've built for years. Mhm. And they're not there anymore. So you have to deal with the pain of not having that anymore. That's my point. Like I'm not I don't have a problem with the separation. Let me give you this example. Mhm. You grow a tree, a fruit tree, whether mango, whether orange. It takes years before you start eating the fruits. Okay. Mhm. The first year you eat the fruits. Very sweet. Very nice. that season goes, you'll have to wait for another season to pick other sweet mangoes from the same tree, not the same mangoes you picked last year. Yeah. Okay. So, [Applause] and the tree continued to grow. Yeah. And when the season comes to bring forth the fruits, it still brings fruits. But the same people, they are not they are not eaten by the same people who ate last year. Even if the neighbors will eat, the tree continues to grow and every season, every season new fruits. So every season of your life you bring you will just have new friends. Every season. Every season. And those who stay with you are the branches. Are the branches cuz the branches they grow with the tree. Tree from the branches but they grow together with the tree. So every season this tree has good fruits and bad fruits the same. So those are the seasons of life. When people fall off, it's okay. It's okay. Continue growing. It doesn't stop you from growing. Continue bringing forth fruits. Don't stop to grow because somebody has somebody else grow. Let me tell you that another example. Uhhuh. The same garden can have mangoes here, oranges here, maybe at apples over there. But just because mangoes doesn't mean doesn't mean because mangoes doesn't mean Yeah. What I'm trying to say is growth is continuous. It doesn't wait. It doesn't stop. You just Oh my god. This this is really good. Well, somewhere along there's a person that has planted an apple tree. Mhm. Evil too. It's like along the road. Mhm. For the long for all season, we thought they were peaches. Cuz all you can see is the color from afar. M. So we kept saying we're going to stop and tune us some. We're going to stop and get some. We're going to and the season. But this person never picked anything from the tree. So the tree has grown grown. The fruits are falling. They are not even some of them have been eaten by birds. Some of them have rotten on the ground. So two weeks ago I decided to stop. First of all, I was so wrong about the tree cuz it was an apple tree. But it's exactly how you said the fruit the tree had so many fruit and now that the season is changing none of them is going to be left on the tree but the tree is still going to grow but also because the season is changing all the fruit is going to fall all the leaves are going to fall it's going to be left brown and then next Yeah. Toa to green to something to something and the cycle starts again. There are some Yeah. When the leaves fall off Mhm. that's your scarcity moment. You still have the branches. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. You still have the branches with you in every season. Whether the tree looks like it's drying up. Are your branches though? Exactly. Do we have those branches that can be with us in all seasons? And that is why I said when we started, if there's somebody who can clap for you when you win Mhm. without envy, those are your branches. Many people will be with you when you are suffering, when you are struggling. But they cannot handle the other side of you when you we some take it as a threat. Some take it as some whatever they take it as. Mhm. Some trees when those fruits fall, when the season is going to end, whatever has fallen might be seeds. Mhm. Other trees will grow from the seed that was never eaten as a fruit. Something will come from the seed that just fell. Maybe ground ground. See, most of us cuz even when you were talking, I was thinking about that tree. The owner doesn't care. Mhm. The owner planted the tree, it's there, doesn't pick it. There's always going to be someone who comes along your way and picks from your tree. To emphasize on your point, you might be a very fruitful tree. Mhm. But you will not eat your own fruits. A mango doesn't eat mangoes. It drinks water. [Laughter] Orange. An orange tree doesn't eat oranges. See, some of us it feels Hey, this is getting to a good point. Anyway, some of us feel like nobody sees you. Have you ever been in that season? It's not that you're not fruitful. It's not like you're not growing but nobody seems to see you. Can I give you an example of the same? Yes. You see that tree that you said you've been seeing it has so many fruits. They look they even they even ripe but nobody eats from that tree. Yeah. Until I That is that moment when you feel that you're growing and nobody sees you. But they're seeing in you and passing like they're like in they just pass and that discourages you. That might discourage you not to grow, not to bring forth fruits anymore. Yeah. Well, yeah. Because if you can bring these kind of sweet fruits there, you you can't eat on your own fruits. People don't want your fruits. They just pass by looking at those good trees, good good fruits. They are intimidated with your win, with your growth. They don't want to pick those tree, those mangoes, those those ripe ones. We want the one that's planted in the orchards. The one that we're going to go pick, the one that puts uh fun the way it looks. Let me tell you. I'm going to wait for you till you're at the top. Then I'm going to need you. Somebody said Uhhuh. Not even somebody said. I'll give you an example. I think I don't remember where I had this example, but a water bottle on a store is maybe $1. Yeah. The same water bottle airport 10 bob. Uhhuh. The same water bottle or club 15 bob. It is the same water bottle. Mhm. But where you you are placed? Where you are placed it is the same one. You see it will still be the same fruit. But how? Mhm. We have the gift. We can move. Mhm. Is it safe to say move yourself to the airport? position yourself the right place cuz I feel like there people in your life that will keep you as that $1 water bottle. You're accessible. You're available. You're there. They don't value you. They know. The problem is it's not it's not even the value. I know what you're capable of, but the son of a carpenter. Yeah, I know what you're capable of, you're there, but where it will be your choice to either be available and accessible to the whole conglomerate that is there would I move myself to a higher place where I'm more valuable increase your worth if if that's a I would say this moving yourself sounds like a lot of work. It's not like to make a decision of moving like do you know what it means? Separation. Exactly. So these have been my friends. These have I need a support team. This is not working. These have been my friends for years. I don't want to lose them just because I'm successful. Now you are deeming your lights. So now to fit in this company, Nika, I have to leave this. So leave, move, position yourself. Yes. Let whoever will move with you follow so that when when you win they win or there's a possibility for them winning because they just right next to you but I don't know if you guys are like me but this journey that you're telling us of moving Mhm. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. For example, I want to leave smoking. Mhm. I cannot just There are some people who just wake up and they're like, I will not smoke anymore. And they But there are some people who will just decide I've been smoking a packet anymore. Mhm. But it is achievable at the same time. Mhm. It has to start with you. It all begins with you. It doesn't start. Nobody else will make will make that decision for you. It has to start with you first. But when it starts with you, when you decide to move then you start a long journey. You don't move. Yeah. That is the long journey to success. And that is why it is difficult for when you move it is difficult for people to handle you in that face in that season of life. You're not the same person anymore. You look so different. You are you don't look so you you are different. You are not the person they knew anymore. You don't speak like you you used to. You don't do things that like you used to. So, what am I supposed to do with you? You follow me and find out what I did. And I'll be kind enough. Mhm. To give you the information. Are we unfair? Mhm. That we want people to behave the same like I can follow you if I want. Mhm. And I follow you cuz I want to be cuz you're getting successful and I want to be part of your journey to success, but I want you to behave or to to relate with me the way you related with me before. Is it unfair? It is unfair. That is unfair. Why I'm saying is unfair is because I remember there's a episode we said build something that people cannot destroy. Mhm. I'm building a character here. Oh, that you cannot destroy. Yeah. So, I am not behaving as I used to. I am not addressing you as I used to. I'm more respectful right now. I am watching my language. I am watching how I speak because I want to speak like success. Have you ever seen people It doesn't matter how Mhm. No, I know what you mean. I I've always like I don't know how people deal with it, but when you're the youngest in the room, so I went to school. M but I was always the youngest in the class. So I went to high school and everybody was like at least maybe 13, 14. I was still like I had just turned 12. Yeah. Like I graduated high school when I was like 16 years old. 16. I was not I was not smart. Like I just don't know how these circumstances happen. I have to ask my parents. me, but I was always the youngest in the room. So that translates to I'm in a job field and the place I'm at 20 years, they're now there. And me, I just came or I'm still young. I'm not as old as you are. And most people will think you don't deserve to be here cuz you're not like me or you haven't gone through the process or whatever. And so I used to complain to my mom. I'm like, uh, this person that I'm working with has been in the company for 20 years and just got promoted to this position and we're having problems. And it went for my first job. She let me quit. The second one, she was like, \"Listen, you're not getting you're not going to change.\" Mhm. Even 40 years from today, you're still going to be the youngest cuz that person also is getting old. M so you have to learn how to talk like you have sense just like you said talk like you have sense carry yourself like you have be the most deserving person to be in that room and for a while I was like this doesn't make sense but I realized if I talked a certain type of way if I dressed a certain type of way if I carried myself a certain type of way people related to me different and so Even now in ministry, I just translated it cuz I'm still the youngest in the room and I have to be seated in tables like now like most people even the people we're doing now some of them are in their 60s 80s and I have to sit in that table like I deserve to be there and not be stupid the the Bible says don't just say talk like a wise person dress. Like the moment you enter into that room, even if they knew you are and they had already disqualified you, they look at you, they're like, but the way they you dress, you enter into a room, they look at you, they're like, and it means that they might be important or things that are relatable to everybody else. Cuz that means that when my peers are doing some certain things, I can't. Yeah. Cuz there's an eye that is looking that will disqualify me if I carry myself that way. And at the end of the day, it translates into success. True. That you'll be able to sit in tables that you probably don't deserve, but by the way you carry yourself. But most of us are slaves of people wanting you to continue to treat them the same way you treated them before. So because you knew me when I was with you somewhere in school, you want us to continue talking that way, but I'm not the same person. And that is the expectations of people. And and that is where if you don't talk to them the same way they expecting, then they are offended. And then you change. [Music] So they having a problem with you because you've decided not to come down to their level. But they if they just follow you to your level, we all succeed. Then you all succeed. My win is a possibility of your win. And you know as much as I am hating the fact they keep telling us about separation but anyway it it maybe is a good thing notice when you're up there. Mhm. Uh let me give this example. You know Bishop O of Winners Chapel, right? The founder. Yeah. So he said when he was just starting Winners Chapel Mhm. he struggled to get a car. Mhm. Then he struggled some days to fuel the car. Mhm. But he was preaching and he said, \"Right now, if I stand here and I'm preaching to you and I say my car does not have gas, someone will go to the store and get me another car. Another one will bring gas. Another one will go to the gas well where they dig and the access that I have now by virtue of rising to this level means that I don't have to ask for some things. truck. You ask me for gas money. I'm like, why did you buy a car if you can't afford gas? But right now, if I just stand here and I'm telling people, I don't have this. They're like, uhhuh, you you cannot be there and you don't have they even buy you a store. You you like I don't have a shoe to wear with this suits. How they address you when you win is not how they address you when you're down there. So our common enemy should be one failure, poverty. Let us just fight poverty and stop fighting each other. Like common enemy should be poverty. It's as simple as that. Two are better than one. Yeah. One kills a thousand, two kills 10,000. You see? Uhhuh. It is very hard. My I don't know who gave this example. I think it's my mom or whatever. If you take a stick easily to destroy you, you can't even break them. Yeah. The unity is what? Hey, a three strand cord is hard to break. So just because I'm up there following me, following me is protecting this cycle, this unity. Leaving me You are exposing me to the enemy and we are good. We are stronger together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are stronger together. And I wish people will see that instead of looking at me as a threat, see me as I go up as a way of u let's go. Yeah. Lifting each other. Cuz I need you. Mhm. And I need you. Let me tell you, but I think it's pastor who are saying that the most difficult seasons of your life or the most times that you need people in your life that I want your money But sometimes you just need companion. That person that is just there to support you. Like you're going up and I'm like, \"Yay, keep going. Keep pushing. You You got this. Let's go.\" And that is bigger support than me telling you, \"He's 200. Keep pushing.\" Let me tell you an example that just came into my mind. Mhm. Just the other day they were having a football in in in Kenya and in Africa. And so it was this narrative that when Tanzania were playing just because their tickets were cheaper, Kenyan bought all the tickets. Mhm. Do you know why? Psychologically if there's nobody cheering you, Chiefs, we had a game with you guys. First of all, we won. Praise the Lord. Start by introducing the same game. What are you talking about? We were It's weird to call it football. Exactly. Anyways, football. He supports Chiefs. I support Eagles cuz that's what normal people do. And we actually defeated you Janna Joy. But we were playing at your place, Kansas. Mhm. And the whole field was red. But the beauty like something really cool I saw there were eagle fans who like flew there. Mhm. And there was like this whole bunch of green that made the game tolerable for these people. Like these people were crazy in the field. And I think they did such a good job of hyping these people. But the first game that Eagles played, I think with the Cowboys and we were playing home, these people entered the field. There was no way. [Music] They were so sad. They lost. They were not motivated. How can you win? Yeah. the same cheer me up if I don't have somebody to cheer me up you brave you like I need a in school I was part of the cheering footballing and we used to do a good job. Did you really imagine school was not in the map? We are coming back home with the same bus. Bye. So it is first come first. And the same thing I will say if you win people will treat you with respect. It is true. It is true. People will treat you with respect. will make sure but it's the right people. We take care of you. The right people. Now, if you don't get these people who cheer you up without envy, Nobody care. But right now And I see my you know like this is a success is a friend and an enemy. When you say it's an enemy, what do you mean? It's lovely and it's something that we all want to be. Mhm. But success has its wounds. M I want to know more because from always talking about it doesn't sound like like to come overnight success and sometimes it doesn't have to be your story a faithful day. It's the things that you have to do to be successful. It might not be but outgrowing a season and people and even leaving people that were in my previous season is also very hurtful when you have to grieve as you move cuz you don't stop. Yeah. That is what I'm trying to to clarify. When we talk about success, we are not talking about money alone. Yeah. We are not just talking about you buying a good car. We are not talking about you buying a a good house. We are not talking about you dressing the most expensive suits or shoes or whatever. That's not the only success. If that is success to you, it is your definition. That's fine. I have no problem with you. But we are talking about success even in character. Yeah. Your emotional health. Emotional health, mental health. Very very important. Yeah. Success. I'm not living this life anymore. This is the route I'm taking. the right way that is success. So th those people who can follow you in that direction are very few very few. It's you've chosen a different path like like just how you said your mental health. Um maybe there's there's a cycle, there's whatever. Even in friendship, there's just friendships that are comfortable because they're familiar, but they're not good for your mental health at all. At all. And you decide to I want to choose myself. I want to take care of myself. Let me move. That journey will come with wounds. These people will insult. These people will do. Do you know why? Mhm. These people insulting you because you have healed and you are reminding them. You are reminding them of their unhealed wounds. move on and you're doing okay. Now what am I supposed to do exactly? We are talking about emotional health and success. I'm not healed. You are healed and you're moving on well and you're happy. So I don't want to be associated with you because I'm reevaluating. Next time when we tell you to pause, it's a very heated episode. But I have this person when I have like my boy moments, they're always available. Like we can be on the phone for 3 hours. If I'm miserable, I if something is happening like girls, I don't know about you, but that friend that is always available when your man does something like we argue and then we on the phone for 3 hours. What did he do? Oh, you deserve better. Oh, blah blah blah blah blah blah. And we're on the phone. This person is always available. I'm being miserable in some other. They're always available. But they will never be available when my my relationship is going well or whatever. They're not available. How dare you? When I call, how dare you succeed? Let's say it's like, oh, uh, he bought me flowers or that conversation doesn't last 10 minutes. I don't like at first I didn't know cuz when you're miserable you just you know you need that time but then I I was having a good a good time and you know you want to share with somebody in your moment of trouble. You will always find somebody to help you to be miserable with me. No not even to be miserable with you to handle that side of you. They can handle this whole night. They will stay with you. If they can they cannot be there with you. No, they they they might not be there with you at that time. But even if it is booking therapy for you, they will pay for you to heal. Like they will find a solution for you to get well. But the problem is when you get well, they cannot handle that side of you. Why? Cuz for me, you see a friend in need is our friend indeed say is a white man. But at first I was like, \"This is a really good friend and we've been friends for for a long time.\" Until my sister was like, \"When it's horrible, this person is always there when you're having a good time. Even even not like a big deal like showing up for your birthday, for your graduation, for your graduation.\" They don't show up. They have excuses. technical 1 hour a mean let me send you let me send you a little gift here but they're not there I'm like you are on the phone with me for hours when I was miserable you know I was I just need you to celebrate with me yeah cuz I was reading your story and it kind of is a sad story so this girl was talking well she was giving her story and then someone was reacting to it and she said she was having miscarriages just and she had had like six of them and it's horrible. It's hard on your own marriage. It's hard on your body. So, but she's saying they were people who are always there. Keep pushing. Keep trying. They will come even to your house. They will stay there. They will cook. They will bring whatever you need. They will wash. They are there for you. They are there. She's like they were there and then because God is good she got pregnant and she got a baby. They couldn't understand that. How? And it's not even at people disappeared. They they they didn't know how to celebrate that. She was like when I was miserable people sent me messages. This person called me all the time. But when I got my baby, they didn't reciprocate that into thanksgiving, into celebration, into I cannot believe this happened. I am so happy for you. I the million messages you're sending her of God. The million memory verses that you're sending you, they don't have celebration memory verses or Thanksgiving, nothing. She was like it was a quiet season which was supposed to be the loudest season of your life when you finally are at a good place. That is why I told you it is lonely at the top. Whatever your top is, your top might be that bundle of joy you're holding like you've been waiting for years. You've been praying for years with people, with prayer warriors, with ushers. But when you finally they are not there to save and thank you with you. When you finally have that bundle of joy in your hands, there are no people to celebrate with you. And that is why I said if you find somebody to clap for you and I will repeat again to celebrate with you without being envy. That is a close person to keep. Those people who show up when you're in problems. Those people who show up when you're in need. Those people who show up in your worst. Mhm. They might not be the genuine friends that you're looking for. That's scary. Cuz you know, we measure people by the ones that show up in your dark because they feel needed. That is why they are there. It is humanity to help. Wow. They feel like a rescuer. They have they are there. They are obligated to do that. Jesus. Mhm. Because they can relate to that problem. A a friend had that problem and they stood with them. Family had that problem. They can relate to what you're going through. But but they cannot relate with your success. Maybe your success or they're just mean people. They never saw you succeeding and they don't know how to handle you in your success. Shindu and let me tell you many of them are not just mean by the way. It's just that they don't know how to handle you in that season. empty. [Music] Finally, [Music] some of them Some of them I got to get what I I need from you any means possible. Exactly. So if you are with me for what I am giving you. I love you still and you're not there. No. is true love. So this is what I will say. Don't I will repeat again. Don't deem your light to fit. Yeah. To your company. Let them celebrate you. Let them clap for you. Clap for the ones that are ahead of you. So that when you are you are going up the way you are treating people is the same way you'll be treated and then don't expect people to treat you the way you don't treat other people I know this will sound very whatever but grow an intentionality and a conscious of always being very cons yeah yeah always be very conscious ious of how you make people feel. Yeah, you're not responsible for my reactions. You're not responsible. But be very conscious of how you make people feel because that will help you to uh grow and have social intelligence cuz I think most people don't have social intelligence and your social equity is probably the most the riches that you will never ever compensate like the people the the same way you said when you have those people that clap for you without envy. Most of us don't take care of that social equity. You don't take care of those people. You don't take care of those relationships. So, be conscious enough of how you treat people. Also, you don't have to take off the crown from my head for you to have a crown on your head. We can all have crowns on our heads. We can all be great and doesn't mean anyone is greater. There's a room for everybody to grow. There is room. Yeah, there's room. There is no competition of like we can all do the same thing and we still have room because we are all unique. Yeah. So don't you don't have to take away my crown for you to wear yours. And that is episode 10 after support. That was a lot. Thank you. It was You're welcome. That ...",

         "🇿🇲MY 1% | Understanding Zambia’s 2026 National Budget\nGovernment has unveiled a K253.1 billion budget for 2026, equal to 27.4 percent of GDP. It is the largest domestic-mobilized budget in the country’s history. Of the total, K206.5 billion will come from domestic revenue, while K12.1 billion will be secured through grants and K34.5 billion through borrowing. The arithmetic shows that Zambia is depending more on its own tax base, but it also highlights how narrow the fiscal space remains, given the weight of debt service.\nDebt and Fiscal Space\nDebt service remains the single largest line item. K52 billion will go towards domestic debt servicing, while K21.7 billion will cover external debt. In total, debt service will consume K73.6 billion, which is more than one third of the entire budget. The Minister highlighted that much of this is due to Treasury bills and bonds issued between 2015 and 2021 now reaching maturity. Even with 94 percent of debt restructured, high domestic interest costs leave limited room for capital investment. This means government priorities will be rationed against what debt obligations leave behind.\nConstituency Development Fund (CDF)\nThe CDF has been raised from K36.1 million to K40 million per constituency, bringing the national envelope to K6.2 billion. Since 2022, this fund has financed 2,800 classrooms and 131 health posts. However, the allocation formula remains unchanged. A constituency like Lusaka Central, with over 150,000 voters, will still receive the same as a remote seat with fewer than 30,000 people. This flat system undermines equity. Reform is overdue. The principle should be a base grant for every constituency, plus a population and poverty-weighted top up. Without that change, the K40 million increase risks entrenching inequality.\nEnergy and Load-Shedding\nEnergy security has been allocated K500 million to establish an Electricity Fund. This will support diversification of the energy mix and finance projects such as the Zambia–Tanzania interconnector. A five megawatt thermal plant is scheduled for commissioning in Lusaka. These steps are positive but too modest for the scale of the problem. The drought reduced hydro output by more than 40 percent, creating a shortfall of nearly 1,000 megawatts. As a result, Zambia has imported expensive emergency power while still exporting under long-term regional contracts. This contradiction fuels public frustration. The solution is not to cancel contracts but to provide transparency. Government should publish quarterly data on imports, exports, and net balances. Citizens must see the numbers to trust the policy.\nSocial Protection and Cash-for-Work\nThe budget sets aside K15.7 billion for social protection, equal to 6.2 percent of the total. Within this, K7.65 billion goes to the Social Cash Transfer, K1.03 billion to Cash-for-Work, and K1.5 billion to the Food Security Pack. Transfers remain at K800 per household, and K1,200 where there is a person with a disability. These allocations are significant, but credibility will depend on execution. Payments must be made on time. Cash-for-Work, in particular, requires redesign. With over K1 billion allocated, the programme should not be treated as temporary relief. It must link participants to skills and small enterprise employment. Otherwise, the fund risks becoming consumption rather than empowerment.\nEducation and Human Capital\nEducation remains one of the biggest commitments. Free education now supports 2.3 million children enrolled in schools. The budget will fund the recruitment of 2,000 teachers in 2025 and 3,500 more in 2026. It will also expand bursaries, with 6,000 additional students expected to benefit in 2026, adding to the 28,212 students supported since 2022. These numbers are meaningful, but quality of education will also depend on timely release of funds for infrastructure, materials, and rural teacher deployment. The new classrooms delivered under CDF must align with these teacher recruitment figures to balance supply and demand.\nHealth and Social Services\nHealth has been allocated K6.4 billion for procurement of drugs and medical supplies, and K953 million for equipment and maintenance. In addition, five new Level One hospitals will be built in Kabwe, Monze, Choma, Zambezi, and Lusaka. This is a response to public pressure after frequent shortages of medicines in 2024 and 2025. The key test will be whether this allocation translates into consistent supply chains, not just headline figures.\nMining, Industry, and Foreign Exchange\nThe mining sector receives K1.2 billion, with K541 million for geological mapping and K449 million for artisanal miners. Copper production is expected to rise toward the one million tonne mark. Output grew by 12 percent in 2024 and surged 30 percent year on year in early 2025. Despite this, the kwacha still traded between K22 and K28 to the dollar, highlighting Zambia’s vulnerability to external shocks. Government has bought $322.6 million worth of gold reserves, and the export tracking framework has channelled $16 billion into the banking system since 2024. These are important monetary reforms, but without a clear foreign exchange stress test in the Budget, public confidence in kwacha stability will remain fragile.\nElections and Governance Costs\nThe 2026 general elections are budgeted at K1.19 billion. This figure, while unavoidable, will squeeze fiscal space further. Government must ring-fence this spending and disclose quarterly release plans. Otherwise, election spending will crowd out critical service delivery in health, education, and infrastructure. On governance, amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act and a new Medium-Term Revenue Strategy are promised. The effectiveness of these measures will depend on political will during an election cycle.\n⬆️ Disclaimer: This analysis is independent and based on the official 2026 Budget Speech.

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nsms (отр) one time passcode\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Hello, good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today, Friday the 26th of September 2025. The day that the minister of finance national planning will be unveiling the 2026 national budget. Uh in the 2025 uh you know budget, government proposed 217.1 billion budget. So everybody is waiting to see how much is going to be proposed for next year. That's 2026. I'm so excited as a jo I'm not alone. I'm joined by my very good friend post who's been doing this all the time you know last week and I know that uh you know there's a lot of people that you have been you know talking to and today is a D finally I don't know why you want to make me feel like I'm a guest but I'm not presenter but anyway thank you so much wherever you are we're excited because the minister of finance any minute from now should be arriving here at parliament We've been interacting with various um stakeholders and the expectations are very very high looking at where the country is coming from the drought uh that uh hit the country and also when you look at the supplementary budget that the minister of finance presented to parliament which was approved by parliament. So a lot of expectations very high. The energy sector uh has faced quite a number of of challenges. Everyone, every Zambian is complaining about uh uh the load shedding, the load management and earlier in the day um a very interesting conversationary fund and Eric uh Luch who who just brought quite a number of issues how the IMF is working with uh the Zambian government to make sure that the debt is restructured. So I'm looking forward to the figures that the minister of finance will be projecting today. Absolutely. And a lot of people actually are saying you know certain you know sectors will be allocated a little more than you know they were located last year like the agricultural sector, the energy sector you know like he mentioned the health sector, the education sector. We know that the president a fortnight when he was here uh to officially open parliament. He actually did say that teachers have been you know recruited for like you know next year. The health sector actually also is recruiting about 2,000 you know health workers and people are saying recruitment yes but there needs to be you know service delivery that is supposed to be improved despite you know you know recruiting all these teachers and health makers. So we're yet to hear what's the minister of finance actually you know going to say regarding that and allocation to a health you know ministry of health the ministry of education and other key sectors of the economy. Well, when you analyze uh the president's address, a fortnight like you rightly put it, at least it will give you an indication how um the road map will be in terms of uh what the president talked about. So, he gave a road map. Now, it's up to the minister of finance to fund uh those pronouncements that the president made during his address when he was officially opening the fifth session of the 13th assembly. So the expectation really really very very very high and u I don't know which sector would you love I'm not going Agriculture. This is a rigorous process and a number of stakeholders have been involved in this process and uh the ordinary Zambian citizen out there have their own expectations. They've been involved in one or the other because we've been having you know conversations with them for and uh they've got quite a number of expectations. So maybe we should you know see what they have to say. The budget estimates and expenditure will be presented by the minister of finance. I know is something that the National Assembly has interest in staff and state orient them. What is expected of them during this rigorous um exercise that will take place start today where uh ized by various uh parliamentary committees that that we have. It's something that I'm looking forward to. Uh members of the excitement it's a time to interact with various they feel and uh I was talking to is excited. parliament that national assembly. Others will have an extension of parliament at Mongushi conference center where their members of parliament will be able to scrutinize uh uh the budget for 2026. And another interesting aspect new dimension worth mentioning is uh the issue to do with cabinet ministers expected now to make policy statements. Previously it was our owner uh the vice president who was handling uh the provinces but at least it's something that various stakeholders were very excited knowing that provincial ministers who are on the ground with these people in all the 10 provinces will be able to make a poly statement and be uh uh given an opportunity to interact with various stakeholders based on their location in in these provinces. Absolutely. So our esteemed viewers will be interested to know that starting next week for the next 20 days business of the house is going to be suspended to enable you know members of was on the inclusive growth and our fingers crossed. We don't know what the minister's will be this time around. So I don't know. We can speculate looking at what the country has been grappling with the issue to do with uh with energy empowerment as well. So I'm very excited for it. I know we all are excited and looking forward to the minister's uh you know budget presentation anytime after 14:15 that is going to be happening right here on parliament you know television. So we need to move on person. Yes, we went around the city of Lusaka just to interact uh with people. Random um expectations were brought out from various uh stakeholders and uh let's us here to some interesting expectations. As you know that my colleague said this project. Are we going to see these voices from various people? Heat. Heat. Where are you? Uh my expectation is to see an increase in terms of uh the budget allocation towards education. Uh for so long there has been um a big gap in the education sector specifically in issues to do with addressing the needs of persons with disabilities of the country. We are interested to hear what is in the in the budget for the finance minister. Following the fact that as you know Zambia has got a lot of childrens that are not yet even in school despite the free education system but others are still languishing in in the communities around there. So we are hoping to see that in the budget that the refinance minister presents is going to is going to cut a bigger portion for the education system as well as in the health sector. the health sector. When you look at the way our patients are being attended out there, at times you even wonder what happens in terms of medicines and stuff because most of the times you take a patient to to a health center, you come to discover that of the medicine website is not there. It will be given to they write a prescription for you and say no go and secure the medicine. Meanwhile, you have come to seek help from a a government hospital which under our perspection as citizens of the country. We are hoping to see that when we get into a hospital 3/4 of the medicine, the treatment that is required must be provided by the government itself. First and foremost, we are looking at education and health. So my expectation from the national budget presentation I look to it that uh uh we expect more um assistive devices to do with education especially in disability sector particularly persons with albinism uh due to their eyes. Number two, we are looking at health health um issues pertaining to persons with albinism especially to their skin. So we we we really think that uh if this is uh added in the uh uh national budget, we we we think we are going to move uh in a right way with the protection of the government as well as um uh also we talk about uh transportation. So the the the national budget if it is also speaking on the transportation uh then that one is going to help because for everyone to move the transport so it's going to help to to enhance their capabilities. I want to see a good education to the people with albinismium. So activity support in terms of education. So uh because we we have challenges in sight. So our expectation as in eastern province as organizations of personities and personities in eastern province our expectation as follows. Um the firstly um we we are expecting uh increasing funding to disability programs. Um what I mean is like in eastern province um there there are only two offices for Zambia for persons with abilities which is a quas institution government institution which issues disability cards to persons with abilities. These are the same card that enables persons abilities to access social protection programs such as social cash transfer. So now because we have two offices only out of the 15 districts is uh very few persons abilities are accessing social cash transfer and other empowerment programs. Um so we expect that in the budget our expectation that uh these offices in each district in the province will have an office so that person abilities can make find it easier uh you know uh to register and to have a disability card. Uh the second issue we're expecting the minister of uh you know finance uh to have to address uh disability related costs when personities are moving from one place to another here in Zambia in terms of issues of transportation. Uh so we we we expect that uh uh government could you know respond uh by you know having policies around disability costs around transport. Then another issue that we're expecting, we're expecting that uh you know government uh uh should also uh uh you know um advise or maybe encourage you know the private companies uh private companies uh to employ you know persons with disabilities and uh should do that uh by sensitizing them on on issues of you know taxation. uh when it comes to youth empowerment so mostly uh according to what I've uh I've observed you find that uh it's more like they they focus mostly on us students like some of us were in who are in school so they should also consider those outside who have business ideas there are people who are not but they areed uh they've got skills and all that so also because they should be empowered. Uh I feel if more funds are directed in building more classroom blocks for the students will help in maintain the high quality of it of students. The government should do something about our school and also about the classrooms cuz we are facing a lot of challenges when it comes to like learning. Uh we know like in class most you are like over populated in class like we have less you know you have less space in class others have been opted to be standing outside through the windows and all that. So just board and you know look at all these angles that you actually facing at even one college at large. My expectations are that they invest more in quality education. For example, here at evening one, we have unfinished uh buildings. We also have more students than rooms. The accommodation is not that good. And for us like farmer students, we learn in labs. We don't have proper desk. We sit on those m tables where we use when making crafts. So I think in education they need to invest more so that they can fit the these buildings, build more classes and we need some desks and stuff like that. Hello. Hello. Hello. Regarding the expectations for the 2026 uh you know national budget which is going to be unveiled today by the minister of finance and national planning. The energy sector has been touched, health sector, education sector. People want to see more monies allocated to these sectors and many more. Now, person let's talk about uh the constituency development bank 2025 um there's an increment of 5.6 six uh billion meaning each constituency is getting to the 6.1 million and there's a lot that has been happening in this constituencies regarding you know projects in con development fund I know you guys 2 months ago I was in China you know province um almost uh 3 weeks ago just commissioning of constituency you know uh offices using uh CDL fans and um this is something that everybody's most of the people are actually excited about especially when you look at you know constituency officers most of them are being members of parliament are using you know the fans to actually build their own constituency you know officers using CDF the right honorable madam speaker has been on record um encouraging members of parliament to utilize CDF and construct um constituency offices because these are many parliaments in these various constituenc But when you go around in certain areas, that's where you find that most of these facilities are just random and people feel uncomfortable to visit these places. But the right honorable madam speaker has been on the floor of the house urging members of parliament to utilize city of component in um constructing um offices and the first one uh to be commissioned was like you've already put it uh 2 months ago and you could see how excited the local people were and the local authority because they are seeing their money working and constructing uh these purposes. I know in amazes constructed in as well not too long we should be seeing that office also being commissioned I think it's it's a good thing seeing that um the money the business money absolutely is working I'm sorry. Another constituent's office that's under construction is the one constituent office any time from now in a few months from now. We do expect the right honorable madam speaker to actually commission the constituency office. So I'm sure most follow suit and have their own constituency office. I think it is a huge challenge to other members of that again. Moa at some point something from their locality infrastructure from construction taking place in various looking what um the local people are benefiting in terms of schools. Mhm. The president is on not too long ago should be 2 years ago when he was talking about he never wanted to see any child sitting on the floor as they go to school because of CDF. seen quite a number of tests being um uh supplied in various uh conferences and again the plus on that parties using manufacturing business. Absolutely. So from 3.6 uh uh uh million each constituency 36.1 million I said 36.1 million each constituency we are yet to see how much you know is going to be allocated how much more is going to be allocated. Are you seeing an impact in terms of my 30? Wow, that's huge. Maybe 50% again. Uh let's wait and see. We can only expect that the minister will be here in a short while. Absolutely. So we moving on. We yet to speak to different you know guests that have been invited and members of parliament that are here to you know witness the unveiling of the 2026 national budget and one of our colleagues Martin actually did have a chat with Mr. Andrew Sun is a senior economist member of the Economics Association of Zambia and the association also have their own expectations in the 2026 uh national budget. Let's hear what You're watching Parliament Television. My name is Martina. On Friday 26th September 2025, the Minister of Finance and National Planning, Honorable Drs. Tum Soan MP will present the 2026 national budget. And so expectations are high as the budget serves as a platform for guiding Zambia's economic direction for the year ahead. And so to help us unpack some of these expectations, I'm joined by Economics Association of Zambia senior economist member, Mr. Andrew Sun who is here just to share with us what Economics Association of Zambia anticipates from the 2026 national budget presentation. Mr. Sun, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. Let me begin by asking from your economist member for what are your top expectations from the 2026 national budget presentation? the budget uh like you rightly put it, it's an economic policy document uh uh guiding uh economic policy for the next uh uh one year. So the expectations u are quite high. Uh number one um we I'm personally expecting um uh government to set a high uh growth economic growth uh uh target because the target has been around has been around 5 to 6%. But I'm uh expecting the government to be uh very aggressive and to be ambitious and uh targets around uh 10% because it's only when you have uh that high economic uh growth in excess of 10. you have those levels of growth that you will have a dent in terms of economic um uh impact in uh poverty uh promoting equality also uh reducing an uh employment and improving the well-being of the people. So it's a high growth that can uh a high growth of 10% that can uh result in a significant impact in uh those macroeconomic variables that I've alluded to. uh what kind of uh tax policies or incentives would you like to see introduced in this budget to support businesses and attract both local and foreign investment? The first thing that I would want to see is uh promotion of the local Zambia uh business person or the local uh theme. So in terms of um uh incentives, I expect the budget I think to give um uh policy guidelines in terms of uh reduction in the various uh uh fees that the small businesses are subjected um are subjected to. I think there's been uh a huge uh uh public outcry uh especially from the small businesses in terms of the fees that are levied on these uh businesses because most of these businesses are still uh in the infancy stage and they are yet to grow. So it's very critical that u the budget uh that to try and uh harmonize and reduce the fees for the for themes as far as incentives for the foreign um uh investors are concerned. uh I think uh what we currently have is u uh sufficient and there's been a lot of focus on uh foreign uh direct investment but it's very critical that we begin to aggressively uh promote the local businessman because growth that is significantly driven by the local businessman will have a greater impact as opposed to invest but every is we need to drive the agenda of the local the local. All right. And ensure national food security. Agriculture. The majority product that is maze. The majority of the maze is produced by the small scale scale uh uh farmers but uh as an inefficient uh way. So I would like this budget to have uh enhanced allocation in term of me and irrigation that's the small scale that is very u uh increase uh productivity and the yield per per field can be can be can be increased. Mr. How should the budget address issues of unemployment especially among young people or graduates who are entering the job market? Government alone uh cannot uh take on all the unemployed we we have. So what is critical to uh direct in terms of promotion of growth of the private sector? There's a not like I said the public sector cannot take on all the unemployed uh uh people. Thank you. All right. When it comes to this delivery in health and education, what key allocations or strategies could you expect the government to emphasize in the government? Emphasis should be uh on education. I expect an increased u uh allocation towards uh education especially in the area of um uh supporting our young uh people who are not able to afford to pay uh school fees on their own that is through the uh we I expect increase in allocation towards um uh the bazaries increased allocations towards uh uh skills development uh training so that we can have uh an educ educated uh uh sector of the economy. How can the budget encourage a culture of savings, investment and greater financial inclusion particularly for people in rural areas and uh small businesses? The uh savings and financial inclusion is very critical if you are to grow uh as a as a as as a business because it's very very important that uh every business uh participates in the uh in the financial sector. So I think what we've seen of late with uh mobile money transactions significantly increasing over the last uh uh uh 3 years I think that is a positive aspect with regards to financial inclusion and uh we expect to see uh the budget uh increased support in terms of promoting uh financial uh inclusion. Mr. As we come to the end of this interview, beyond short-term, what long would you like the 2026 budget to lay the foundation for in order to build a more resilient economy? So, we've got the eighth national uh development uh plan and then we've got the uh the medium-term u uh budget plan. So, I expect the budget to uh align to those um in the long term. Like I said in my uh preamble, we should uh see an increased uh support to the locals in terms of um uh promoting uh the locals in all the sectors be it mining, increased support to the artisan miners, be it in agriculture, increased support to the to the to the small scale uh uh farmers and then obviously um we've experienced uh certain challenges as a country with regards to uh energy. So in terms of the medium to longterm uh the budget should be seen to be uh addressing those energy because without any uh growth of an economy Mr. Sunen I would like to thank you so much for featuring on our program. Thank you very much. All right that was economics association of Zambia senior economist member Mr. Andrew Sun sharing insights and shedding light on the expectations ahead of the 2026 national budget present in national planning. Honorable MP will on my name is Martin Bura.

And these recruitments have a government to achieve a goal of ensuring that all health facilities have at least one qualified health personnel to ensure quality healthcare. And uh he did say that uh the increase in the number of front health workers has contributed to reduction in maternal and child mortality as um 82% of deliveries are conducted by personal due and um 2,000 again in the health sector being put this year. The number of recruitments that will take place in which sector that are going to be employed? Is it going to be doctors? Is it going to be nurses?

And uh that's the minister of finance and uh we also expect the speaker's position to make its way into the chamber in a few minutes uh from now and business uh will get started. And so we were just uh having a recap of uh the speech that the minister of finance did you know present in the 2025 national budget. Uh talking about energy that's uh you know one sector portion that everybody is talking about. uh we've been grappling with electricity issues and we know that exports um uh the the director at um the uh Zambia electricity supply corporation actually did say that uh you know exports of electricity have actually decreased to allow you know consumers here in the country to have you know more power that's one way of alleviating this you know power crisis that we are facing. The minister of uh energy was on the floor of the house rendering a ministerial statement and I'm sure he managed to put a smile on many Zambians because of uh the announcements that were made regarding the number of hours that uh people will be um having terms of uh electricity. So uh very expectant we await to hear uh what measures u the minister of finance or the don government has put in place to make sure that u the impact of uh load management is reduced. So uh that's the minister of finance just working majestically with a grand there uh going to do what Zambian have been uh looking forward to in terms of unveiling the 2026 uh national budget.

To this end, government will undertake legislative structural and policy reforms in a number of areas such as fiscal policy, domestic resources, resource mobilization, date management and um uh decentralization.

The remaining eligible VA taxpayers are required to register on the system by 30th September of this year will now will not recognize any invoice issued outside the system. My no government wants to maximize revenue collection. And not too long ago, members of parliament uh had a privilege uh to um be um uh oriented or being given an update by the Zambia Revenue Authority at Sienna Resort right here in Musaka where uh it was a tax symposium and how the government tends to um increase revenue collection from mine. So I I I'm looking forward to an update from the minister of finance in this year's um uh uh budget presentation. How many uh people have registered for smart invoice so that government can maximize revenue collection? That's the only way we see the economy boost and um have a better economy. Absolutely.

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nznbc lusi for you\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:liabilities and we will require obviously um additional resources that are speaking to economic recovery. So depending on what areas we put that economic recovery in whether we're putting additional funds towards CC uh CDF and and obviously the credit guarantee scheme in terms of having to do to cover the recovery for the private sector. All right Caroline, your impression with regards to what is about to come um in our accountance in a few hours from now. That's right. Thank you, Brian. So, primarily for us, we're looking at a smart budget. I think the presentation should reflect that. And by smart budgeting, we are specifically talking about how you balance and leverage on some of the gains that we saw in as opposed to of course the social uh uh spending. It should not only reflect the income and expenditure. I think we need to move away from this and that is my expectation. And my expectation is to see how in as much as we are targeting certain key sectors when it comes to social protection and social sectors, we need to also be smart about it in terms of plowing back into the sectors that will enable us to grow this economy. I think to strike that balance it's very important because if you do not strike that balance you find yourself in a situation where majority of the allocation of the budget is going to consumption instead of production. What do I mean? We need to ensure that in as much as we are spending towards the consumer, the social sectors, I am hopeful and desirous to see that this budget presentation also puts enough resources into the very sectors that got us the economic gains that we're talking about currently. And these are sectors of course such as the mining sector. We're talking about the agriculture sector including the tourism sector. And a lot has been happening in these sectors. Not forgetting the energy sector which is the backbone of every other sector because every other sector cannot be sustained without energy. This is a given. So this is not to negate the fact that in as much as we're looking at such allocations, we also need to look at the allocations that will now go to things such as you know CDF and also we've seen cash for work. This is something that you know the government uh through the policy direction during the present during the address uh the parliamentary address by the head of state spoke to when it comes to the increment we saw a projected increase in the recruitment of health workers. We saw a projected increase of 2,000 additional teachers in the education sector. There is the homegrown feeding program. So all these yes we must be able to see uh money being put into these um uh projections but also we should not forget the fact that in as much as we are looking at the social sector and hoping for an increase in the social sector because this is where the micro is happening. This is where our people are directly benefiting from for example the inflation rates going down from the GDP projections of 6%. So we are desirous of seeing a smart budget in this case from the minister which puts all these things into uh consideration to ensure that we grow even at a faster rate than we consume as a country. All right, Matsung, thank you so much. And um I think for me it's a budget that's coming at a time when um the extended credit facility is expiring on the 25th of October and then there was that technical extension that was given to January 2026 and then there's a 12 month request that has to be looked at. So the question is from a primary surplus I mean primary uh surplus perspective what do we think the budget should look like anywhere maybe between 2 to 3% budget surplus uh it's also a budget that's coming at a time when Zambia just came out straight out of a drought 40 year uh the worst drought in 40 years um drought in itself like my fellow panelists have put on the table uh consequences within the energy sector. So we've seen reforms that happened this year, but the question is for some of those reforms to actualize, infrastructure is critical. For example, for open access to thrive, we need infrastructure, additional grid capacity. And I'm expecting to see an allocation towards building of infrastructure to accommodate the additional energy demands. We are looking at interconnectors. we should be able to connect with our neighbors that have excess power. Um on the petroleum side, I think there's been some positive pronouncements around us taking up stake within a loito refinery which is Angola. So not sure if this budget as well will have resources that will be channelneled towards us taking up that stake because it definitely needs to be funded. If it's going to be owned by the government, it has to be um funded. Uh let me talk about mining. I'm not expecting a lot within the mining space because uh most of what the mines uh were crying their bentleys over was already addressed in terms of double taxation and all that and we've already seen mining bearing fruit. But I talk about mining deliberately because Zambia has a target to hit 3 million metric tons. So obviously one of the macroeconomic targets would be to hit 3 million metric tons. But you can't mine without electricity and that's where the infrastructure uh uh piece then comes in. From an agriculture perspective, I'm expecting continuation of the comprehensive agriculture support program. That program should have been implemented sort of aggressively last this year. But then came drought. So I'm expecting that infrastructure, road networks, electricity access, building of dams just to build that resilience and to shift because comprehensive agriculture support program is now shifting agriculture from the demand side which was price fixing to the supply side which is now wealth creation. What we want is a farmer in Poro should start out as a peas and farmer and eventually graduate to a commercial farmer. But in a nutshell, the debt piece has already been ably covered by Trevor because uh we restructured debt which is a great thing but we now need to start servicing and then domestic debt is ballooning. So domestic debt areas need to be dealt with because that represents liquidity that the private sector is stopped. So I think it's a it's an interesting budget that we get clues from everything that has happened. the positives weighed against the negatives, but then it also completes a fiveyear cycle by the Ministry of Finance because we're talking about one year to an election. So, we're getting to a fiveyear cycle. So, the question is, it's a continuation of programs that already started, but then we just want to be clear about how they'll be funded. Lastly, from a taxation perspective, uh it's a very uncomfortable topic, but I do expect that there may be some adjustment on the taxation side to increase revenue because the government pur uh requires revenue. But the caution on the positive would be that if you look at the metrics in terms of public debt to GDP ratio, I think the projections from the IMF is that we close this year at just under 92 and then graduate to 79 and to 64 and that will be creating fiscal space. So it'll be interesting to see how those projection projections then fit into the budget because then we expect a little bit of fiscal space coming from um the Ministry of Finance. Listen, when you load down all these expectations right now, I don't I don't envy the the minister of finance. There's a lot of weight on his shoulders and in a few hours from now, you'll be appearing on your screens to give us what he has planned to spend in terms of the next financial year.

Thank you very much to all our partners that have made this broadcast possible. must mention that this live broadcast is brought to you by the Zambia Institute of Charted Accountants, Fibercom and Public Service Micro Finance Company. Now our first stop is the health sector. This is because this is a sector that is very critical in shaping the social economic development of the country with shocks from donor funding reduction. Pres speaks to some of the stakeholders on just what the expectations are from the budget presentation. The health sector is a cornerstone of Zambia's development as it plays a critical role in enhancing quality of life for citizens, strengthening communities and ensuring a stable social economic environment. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that investments in healthcare is not merely an expenditure, but rather a foundational element for sustainable economic productivity. Stakeholders like the Zambia Medical Association are at the forefront for advocating for improved healthcare. Dr. Masopiri, president of the Zambia Medical Association, highlights the association's budget expectations for the year 2026. The Zambia Medical Association first and foremost commends the new Dawn government for its consistency in uh increasingly allocating resources towards the health sector uh for the four years they have been in their reign and so our expectation is that even in 2026 there will be an increase in their allocation towards the same as they have been progressively doing. This is commendable as it shows um a direct commitment to the health sector budget. The pharmaceutical industry plays a vital role in ensuring access to essential medicines. Keegan M, president of the pharmaceutical association. He's hopeful that the budget will allocate more funds to further enhance accessibility to medicines. Our expectations in the budget is that um number one we expect an increase in the drug budget. Currently we are standing at 4.9 billion uh which is not enough especially that uh we've been supplemented by uh donors who have been giving us uh more than 5 billion u per year and when we put this together it means that we've been running on a budget of 10 billion. So this time around we want uh our budget to be locally generated and planned for everything. Nurses are the backbone of Zambia's healthcare system. F Melo, president Zambia Union of Nurses and Midwives organization acknowledges the recruitment process as one of the biggest gains last year. He is optimistic that this trajectory will continue when funding is increased to the health sector. There's a lot actually that uh would happen to the health sector such as it would it would enhance the welfare of all aspects of uh health workers in this country specifically the nurses and midwives and also enhancing the service uh delivery. As the finance and national planning minister Dr. Stobe Sokoani presents the budget to the nation, stakeholders have their eye on increased allocations for the sector's growth and development depends on strategic budget allocations. Best reporting. Thank you. Now colleagues I'd like to bring you in at this particular time and when we talk about the health sector uh we know for a fact that there was some news in May that was very devastating with the US cutting 50 million that's about 1.4 4 billion quatcher in in annual and you know annual aid provided to Zambia for medications and medical supplies the impact of this development extremely grave on the current budget so there's a void that needs to be filled by this case resources right now if you in the shoes of the minister how would you play around that that that quagmire so to speak very interesting position um firstly in terms of the health sector obviously is that it speaks to the health of everybody in the country and um it is one of the key areas in which we allocate funding from our budget. Um but it is important you remember you must understand that in terms of resource allocation there are a lot of competing needs and if you ask anybody everybody wants an increase in that area and I think the first area that we must obviously start from is that obviously recognize the fact that there's there's there's a deficit that we are facing because of the the withdrawal of the deh of the uh donor funding and this will require to be covered. So whatever that portion is is that the minister would require to be able to allocate these funds to cover that deficit. Um but it means that it it has to be taken from somewhere else where that need is and and um last year is that the health sector got 23 billion quatcher in terms of the 2025 budget uh which was 10 point 10 10% of the overall budget. So essentially is that you'll expect um this increase to continue. The interesting aspects that you do see is that yes we had an increase in terms of the budget to 217 but um the actual value of the budget didn't actually increase because if you're using the nominal value of the dollar is that the budget actually reduced slightly in 2025. Although it changed the dynamics when we had the supplementary budget that it went to 259 but essentially is that you would expect that they will at least increase the 50 million that was withdrawn from the donor funds. All right. Do you think this is going to see an increase in terms of the I mean obviously it's going to be an increase in terms of the whole budget because we've got the elections coming to the four but do you think also that developments that unfolded in the health sector in this budget will compel the minister of finance to again increase the budget further? I I think so. I I totally agree with that assession and the reason for this um is very simple. Uh we have a deficit currently because of the shock that we suffered when the donor funded um or the donor input was withdrawn. I must just also put it on record here to say that I think it is also uh a blessing in disguise so to speak. For the longest as a country, we've depended so much on donor funding when it comes even with issues of health. And I think this is something that will give us um that impetus to begin to look within our own resources and plan our resources to cut for the gap that we are seeing currently. And so what it is now to put it plainly and simply is that we had a budget previously that was supplemented by the donor funding and currently out of that equation is that funding that we were expecting year in year out and moving forward we are saying that there has to be that gap filling of that deficit that we are facing. And so in in in simple terms, yes, the minister has to of course um explain to us Zambians and stakeholders where this money will come from in terms of mobilization of resources to be able to bring us at par in terms of where we were before the deficit. in terms of an increment I'm thinking it would be a bit uh of a push or pushing it uh in terms of how he plays around with the resources looking at the competing needs that are out there. So right now what we are hopeful or what we are looking to see is if we cannot do anything else at least let us bring us to speed in terms of where we were at before the the deficit before the pulling out of the donor funding and if anything it would be good to see an increase in terms of what you asked me uh there's been so much that has been happening in the health sector and this is not in isolation. We've seen the creation of so many health centers and with health centers of course comes with um a lot of nurses in terms of manpower health workers and there's already a projection of 2,000 additional uh health workers. Uh so of course again we're looking at uh issues to do with the quality of health that our people will be receiving and this just does not just end with uh the health worker themselves. We're talking about equipment and machinery and of course the medicines. But also I'd like to just mention here in terms of how um this budget will reflect the the strengthening of uh the system the health system when it comes to pilerage of medical supplies because it's like you're making so much progress but at the end of the day you have holes in a bucket and there's so much leakage when it comes to public resources being prudently utilized. So primarily we expect to see that that uh increase in terms of maintaining uh the the the the resources uh but if we could do better that would be good to see in terms of the trajectory that the government has taken. All right Mungi I'll bring you in to talk about you know um economic um growth and economic recovery. Um and obviously we blend in the issue of the mining sector which now is back on its wheels and we just wonder to what extent that's going to impact the budget and the resource mobilization as far as the country is concerned. Don't forget we've got an audience with us in the studio when we're talking about about health. I noticed you guys got a bit concerned. Uh is anybody willing to give us their thoughts regards this sector and what you expect as far as the budget is concerned? Um there's a microphone there. Yes, my name is Don't worry that microphone is in the budget. All right. Yeah, my name is Sam. What I expect from this from this budget is the health sector is not doing very well currently and uh we need new medication in terms of we need the budget for for for the for this for this for this year supposed to for next year is supposed to increase in terms of medical facilities are not at par with the economy which we we are on. All right. And uh moreover the the the GDP is increasing and the population is increasing. So the health sector is supposed to to provide for for those who are going to be suffering from sickness and mental health and also the the government is supposed to to provide for mental mental health for students and these youngster who are coming up. So I'm looking forward to to the increase in med medical in health sector in terms of medicines and personnel also. All right. Oh, thank you very much. We'll get more of those, you know, thoughts from you as we progress with the program. Let's take a short break. When we get back, we'll be biting our teeth in economic growth and economic recovery. And of course, we will look in the mining sector and other, you know, sectors that go with growth and economic recovery. Stay with us.

Let's get to the country's um you know, major um um wealth earners, so to speak, the mining sector. And as you know that there's been a lot of you know happening as far as that is concerned and um our staffer you know severe was sitting down with the mine unions on the copper belt and they are saying the budget needs to have more funding to the ministry of labor uh to address some of the challenges facing the labor movement such as safety and decent wages. entrusted with it is the time for the 226 budget presentation and the expectations are high on the copper belt. The mine unions have put in what they want to see in the budget. Tax regimes or increase in some taxes that should be pronounced. They must also be able to to be job protective. shouldn't be policies that or taxes that will come to warranty dismiss of of workers. What would want to see in the budget is supportive values in terms of like the minister of labor which is our ministry. We have had a lot of new investors that have come on board but we have seen inadequates in terms of outreach of our officers in terms of the labor ministries. But what about the dollar and this chamber of commerce and the industry? We anticipate that funding for health and education will continue to rise. We would also like to see budget provision to mitigate the risk of climate shocks. Additionally, more investment in mining exploration and infrastructure to help reach the 3 million ton copper production target. I also had a chat with some economic experts on what the 20.6 budget should look like. We've seen turnover tax going up last steadily for last five six years. Initially it was to 3% after a bit of time it went to 4%. Last year it went it went up to 5%. So it' be it'd be good to see some relief on that front. Programs which have largely contributed to the economic growth in um in in the year of 2025 should be not only doubled down but um increased and that's where most of the focus should be like the 1 million farmers in the farmer input support system and the deaf community also gave their take on the 2026 budget. So in the budget line for 2026, we would want to see more person with disability be employed and also the sector of employment we should also endeavor that we include more who who who are channeled to to to speak to the plight of person with disability news gateway some tax relief taxes in this I'd like to get your impression with regards to the mining sector. Lots of talking points come from there. the mining sector is now back on its wheels. Um you just wonder what what is going through you know the mind of the minister as far as ensuring that this sector is pumped up so to speak. Okay. So yes the mining sector is in boom phase right now and if you look at production year on year I think half year we're looking at four 436,000 metric tons and that's obviously on track to just hitting a million metric tons by the end of the year. It's a critical phase because on one end the environment is conducive, production is going up, investments are trickling in. If you go onto Kafu road almost every day, you will see heavy machinery and all that is going towards the copper belt of Africa. When production goes up married with the prices of base metals on the London metro exchange, that's a good thing because then you look at your mining revenues and everything is booming. The interesting thing about mining is that when mining booms downstream business because there are businesses that are dependent on mining and that's why they call mining uh Zambia's golden hedge against global volatility. So yes it's booming and some of the targets that Zambia set may be aggressive but pretty much um achievable but it also comes with its own uh undertones. So mining is a sector that is wide. You have artisanal miners as well that are pushing in one direction and they feel that they've been dubbed illegal miners and they would like a conducive environment for them to thrive because you start from anme and then gradually you graduate into a corporate. So these are some of the things that are going to be looking at how do how does government then formalize and create uh a structure that will accommodate artisano mining for the big mines. Yes, there have been a number of plagues. We are seeing them actualize. And um if you put your eye on Zambia, you'll realize that there's something happening in the world that most people uh are not paying attention to. We've got the electric car era. There's renewable energy. There's artificial intelligence which everybody's not talking about. If I take you to the US, there's a Stargate program $500 billion. What that entails is that they're going to build data centers. Data centers are energy intensive and they require copper and that's why you will see a string of investors coming to court Zambia. Just this week you had finances and FQM meeting the president. Why do you think global bankers would fly from one corner of the world to the other? is because they're positioning themselves for this revolution that is about to take place and Zambia and DRC are at the center of it and that's why you see that on the eastern side you've got Tazara which is being revamped at a billion dollars on the western side you have loito corridor on the issues that speak to mind safety those are very critical we can't compromise uh compromise and because we are in this E and S era where it's environmental social you can't have pollution uh and and not preserve nature capital. So the expectations are what is government going to do? What are we going to see in terms of allocation in terms of fines that they will introduce to uh mitigate some of those other risks. Um the other job concerns are things that year in and year out have always been there. And look um I think it's always critical to look after staff. I won't dwell so much on that because it's the nitty-g gritties of the operating environment of each and every entity. But in a nutshell, I would say there's a boom. It's definitely supporting growth and it's a wave we must not miss because copper is flirting with highs of $10,000 a metric ton. We can't afford to miss this because that is where the cash flow to service debt to pay for those se sectors that people are anticipating increases and put the government in a position where its fiscal purse is adequate enough to allocate resources adequately uh in in in in key sectors and and drive the economic agenda. For that to happen, you need policies that ensure that Zambia stands in a place where it benefits. a great deal from this boom in in terms of the need of copper on the global economy, isn't it? Yes. Yes, Brian, you absolutely do. And um just maybe to speak to some of the stakeholder um outcomes that we saw just now, we need to as a country be able to appreciate the very fact that yes, the mining sector is a big one for us. It's a Qashqa. That is where our resource base uh mainly resides. And so we're talking about of course issues of taxation here and and I I I know for a fact that I think it will be detrimental to overt tax in a way because in the end you'll find situations where most of the mining uh companies will not be able to operate uh in in what would make business sense and at the receiving end of such an eventuality are the Zambian people those that are employed within the mines. So we need to strike a balance and the government needs to strike a balance when it comes to how we can leverage this sector which at this you know point in time is performing at its optimum. Of course there's you know reason to improve there's room to improve but looking at the prices you know um global market prices when it comes to our mineral and the demand in itself and also looking at all the policies and you know initiatives that have gone into the mining sector starting 2021 when it comes to reopening of mines and also the target that we're looking at in terms of higher production of co we need to begin to explore other avenues other than just the the taxing aspect I think we need to look that value addition. I think that one is very key. Uh also we need to look at supporting the locals in a big way and I think um this sentiment resonates with what one of the the the speakers just from the vox swap we've seen now was talking about in terms of labor issues. I think it is important that we go back to the drawing board. I know for a fact that uh you know just after independence when the mines were being run we saw towns develop on the premise of the mines themselves. We would like to see that robust um you know uh prosperity come back to the towns and cities where these mines are operating. And how do we do this? We need to have deliberate and robust policies in terms of how the mining sector gives back to their communities. And this is not just in in terms of employment. We're looking at in terms of supply of of goods and commodities that the mines require. I think it is important that we are more deliberate and we expect the government to ensure that policies are directed in such a way that the mining owners, the business owners in the mines are deliberate when it comes to uh sourcing of um goods and services to benefit the local people. Okay. Trevor, briefly before you get talk about the issue of the energy sector, your comment regards to the mining sector. Should we, you know, um, upscale the tax regime when it comes to the mining sector, you think? Um, so firstly, I think there's always been an issue that we've had as a country around how much tax we're generating from the mining sector and especially from...",

         "US Slaps Zambia & Malawi With $15,000 Visa Bond — Is This Fair?",
         "The U.S. has just imposed a controversial $15,000 visa bond on travelers from Zambia and Malawi. Many are calling it discriminatory and unfair, while others say it’s about tightening U.S. immigration rules.\nWhat does this mean for Africans who want to travel? And why are countries like Zambia and Malawi being targeted?\nIfy Igwe reports on the U.S. visa bond policy and its impact on African nations.",
         "Тексты с изображений\r\nvifsia s15k for 7.4. afnican u.s. visa sc\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:$15,000 is no joke. And when the US starts requesting that from you in order to be let into their country, then you know it's time to actually develop your own country some more. There's this quiet storm brewing and it's hitting two African nations first, Malawi and Zambia. So, the United States government has just announced a policy that directly targets citizens from these two countries, and it seems so absurd. It requires them to pay visa bonds of up to $15,000 just to enter the US on a tourist visa. $15,000 just to visit, not for business, but to visit. Now the official narrative is that this move is meant to discourage visa overseas. But we must ask why start with Malawi and Zambia, two small peaceful nations with relatively low travel volumes to the US. Let's just break this down a step further. So according to the US Department of State, this new policy is part of a 12 month pilot program aimed at countries whose citizens allegedly overstay their visas at higher rates. Right. And this is effective August 20th. Citizens of Malawi and Zambia applying for a tourist visa will be required to pay a bond ranging from $5,000 to $15,000. Think about it. If they leave the US before their visa expires, they get the money back. If they overstay or apply for asylum, the US government keeps the money. But where did they even get that amount of money from in the first place? Let's look at the actual numbers. So in 2023, only 1,655 people from Malawi and 3,493 people from Zambia entered the US for tourism or business. Of these people, just 237 Malawians and 388 Zambians overstayed their visas. Social media has been filled with so many opinions, right, about this with some people comparing those figures to 20,811 Brazilian overstays and over 40,000 from Colombia and asking why those countries aren't being slapped with such demands and bonds, at least not yet. So again, they ask, is the US targeting small African nations first? What happens to the students, to the professionals who are lawful travelers who already jump through hoops just to secure a visa interview? Now they're being asked to produce up to $15,000 not for entry, but as a security deposit for their intentions. Where do where do they get that amount of money from? It's pretty much telling them don't come here. There are also different African social media forums debating this recent news and they're saying that this move isn't about national security that it is about power, it's about profit and profiling. What do you think about? Do you think they're they're correct? So here's my thing. You need to understand something. This is the power of sovereignty. Every sovereign nation has the right to want their country the way they want. So, we can't be mad at that, especially when they're doing it for the best interests of their nation, right? So, we we just can't be mad. The Council on American Islamic Relations called this particular move a legalized shakeddown. Their spokesperson, Robert Macar, said, and I quote, \"This is not about national security. It's about weaponizing immigration policy to exort vulnerable visitors, to punish disfavored countries, and to turn America's welcome mat into a payw wall. Is he right? What are your thoughts? Drop your thoughts in the comment section. We can't help but point out that to an extent, this is how systems of global inequality may operate. Not just through bombs or borders, but through bureaucracy. bureaucracy like this through policies and through such fees that price out black and brown people from so-called land of opportunity. For many Africans, travel is already a financial and emotional burden for them. Visa application fees, flights, accommodation and now this like I mentioned this is the power of sovereignty. Every country has a right to do what they want. This could be seen as cruel because it also affects people that are playing by the rules, the students, the people who are going in for business and wanting to come back to their country. The people that are applying legally. Some people have called this postc colonial prejudice. It's a tough one, but like I mentioned, every country has the right to do just that. You can't tell any country how to run its affairs, their house, their rules. But what are your thoughts about this? Do you think it's a bit harsh? And what should the next move be for Malawi and Tanzania? You know, in global politics, there's something called reciprocity. These African nations have every right to retaliate. After all, the US also has interests in their country. So, they have to be bold enough to play the game of global politics. It's all about leverage, right? It's about having that leverage. Africa will always have natural resources that the west always needs and that that in itself is massive leverage and they can use that as a leverage. Africa must learn to use what it has to get what it needs. Africa is awakening but we should awaken some more. Malawi and Zambia must rise some more. They must ensure that they own their power and they are able to and they are bold enough to stretch the the influence of their power because so far you have leverage based on the natural resources that you have. People also have to play by your rules. The world is watching. What are your thoughts about this? My name is Ephie reporting from Nigeria. This is the Africa Diaspora News Channel. We'll see you on the next story.\r\n",

I don't mind the distance you are from here. By no grace is sufficient on you to tap in the grace upon this in the name of Jesus Christ son of the living God. Somebody hold. Amen. Your amens are minimal at least. Every time I come, I have a question. I question myself. Why do you come in this place? Why do you come repeatedly, [Music] month after month, week, week after week? year after year. If it is not God, woman and gentlemen who can keep you in one place, [Applause] if it is God who causes you to come, clap your hands and scream for him. Hallelujah. [Applause] It shall come to pass as it is written in Psalm 84 verse number seven to them that went before God went from power into power. Each one of them appeared before God inside. Thou shall sift from power to power. [Music] I speak of the grace in this place. You are like a phone brought for charging. I pray you won't leave the Sabbath without a next BH. Let me say again. Except you have not switched over. I have never been angry like I got when I I think I have plugged in and switched on and yet you have not switched on. You wait for the whole hour and you come to take away your phone and the phone say battery is low. How many of you have ever experienced it? I speak to you today. You want to leave the service. So make sure. So make sure that you are plugged in and switched on because it said in Hebrews 11:6 11:6 of Hebrews it says but without faith it is very impossible to please the Lord God because for he who comes before God They must believe that he is here. [Music] I make a decree to you. My seeking won't be in vain. It doesn't matter when you will boast in your seeking God. It doesn't matter how long. There shall be a vivid distinction. Time of your lunch you invested in God. These are the reason that is the how that those are the land. This is the is the victory screaming to shout amen. I am here believing that God is in this and he's a reward of us who seek him. Anybody seeking God this make a joyful noise [Music] of the Lord. Someone is about to open with the intentional [Music] verses 130 the entrance of your word. It gives life entrance of it causes the simple to understand. in a few minutes. [Music] You're brought to have light. You're brought to have understanding. And after your understanding, my life will never be the same. Say it again. After I have received understanding, my life will never be on the same bar. Those who are educated are not like those who are not educated. The illiterate and illiterate have a distinction. I decree the name of the Lord. You have to have life. Are you there? Hallelujah. Shout hallelujah if you are there. I make a decree to you. This is where we get to know. There is nothing new under the sun. Do you know that it is only God who has new things because he's the one who saying that they see I do something new will you not see will you not know about it I am prophesying everything that has been anything old that was Amen. Do I have those who love God? Do you have anyone who loves God in this place? I expect to qualify to see new things. [Music] Isaiah 43:19, he said, \"Behold, behold, behold, I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall you not know about it, even I will make a road in the wilderness?\" Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [Music] I'll put rivers in the desert. I decree you every man and woman has understood for God is about to do something new. [Music] In verse number 26, rivers in the desert, rivers in the desert, I decree to you that wilderness will have springs of water. that wilderness. My good lord. [Music] Those who love God here. What eyes have never seen ear? God is releasing them to you today. 1 Corinthians 2:9 said as it is written what eyes has not seen nor ears heard that which has which has never entered into any man's hand. These are the very things God has prepared. Those who come for lunch hour [Music] what no man has ever seen. Think about it. There's something they have never seen in my family. [Music] He has prepared them for you. He has prepared them for you. Do you know why he has done so? Because you love him. Today we're going to pray. We are going to pray today. No more testimonies. What is it? There is a testimony that will come out of your already started testifying. Have your seat for 120 seconds. Yes. Yes. The Lord is good. You know, hallelujah. And a man shouting pays not a bill. But they that screams after they pay the bills and God blesses them. is saying thou shall have money. I'm not saying because you bring 10,000 you will have money. You're going to be great. You're going to be very distinct. There shall be clear distinction upon your life. Money is going to come. This is my prayer. Don't become crazy when money comes in. Don't be confused. God is going to help you. You will get to a level of having money which you cannot count for. [Music] I can never forget those days where I could go back in the pockets of my trousers to check the coin the man I have left there but you check and you don't even find a coin but these days as you're there someone tells Papa, this $1,000 was left somewhere here. [Music] That is clapping, looking at me forett,00 How can I forget a million in my wallet, my pocket, and I forget that I have it? for getting money. Nobody should help you. As if you have nevered the entire campa [Music] which has never entered no man's heart. God has prepared them for you. And you know I tell you and you you think I'm feeling myself. I'm telling the truth because I'm I'm born again. I have built more than 10 buildings, but I have never built the one which is on stor. I want to ask these people who build down on the earth houses. How how do you do? I'm just asking down on earth houses. I want to ask how do you do it? Cuz when we are in the sunny season, when the sun is scorching, I tell people when in the night you feel that heat. What about this one? It's breaking around. Take the same anointing. How can I spend all this and it doesn't come to you? Impossible. [Music] [Music] He will build and I've also discovered this one. I I don't do it intentionally. While I am building I'm constructing this one. I'm also constructing another. I build it two at once. How do you do it? That's what they call. [Music] It may start with those who believe that before you leave the earth you will be destroyed then we will create the normal overed upon people's lives the [Music] I received the freely. Good Lord. [Music] That is grace. [Music] You told it to friend. You told it to. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] That's [Music] [Music] [Music] Somebody speak of the grace you are. Are you taking speaking? Take the grace. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Foreign [Music] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] [Music] I've come [Music] so [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

Proverbs 19:24, a lazy man his hand in the power and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. Food was too heavy for him for you. How can you receive such revelation? You bring your one yet.

         "Tanzania has condemned the resurgence of violations of international law, a trend that encourages the use of force as a means of resolving disputes.\nThe country stated that such practices not only undermine global efforts to maintain peace and security but also endanger the lives of innocent civilians in conflict-affected areas.\nIt emphasised that the use of force has become a source of human rights abuses, particularly affecting children, women, the elderly, and the sick.\nThese remarks were made by Vice President Dr Philip Mpango during the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States.\nSpeaking on behalf of President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Dr Mpango highlighted that this weakening of international norms is driven by imperialistic attitudes, including the perception of Africa as a target for resource exploitation and land grabs.\nHe added that multinational corporations continue to thrive by exploiting Africa’s natural resources, often causing or supporting conflicts, a situation that must end immediately.",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Our planet often reveals landscapes that blur the line between reality and illusion. [Music] There are places so strange they seem to exist only in dreams, yet they stand real on Earth. Here, nature acts like a surreal artist shaping visions beyond imagination. [Music] Those who arrive are not only amazed by the beauty but also reminded of their smallalness in the vast universe. [Music] And now let us embark on a journey to discover unreal places that unbelievably truly exist around us. [Music] Old man of store in Scotland is a bassalt pillar about 160 ft tall created after surrounding softer rocks collapsed and eroded. [Music] The process took millions of years, leaving a hard rock column that stands alone and can be seen from far away. [Music] Its main material is volcanic bassalt showing evidence of ancient tectonic and eruptive activity in the highland region. [Music] The nearby area preserves signs of large landslips, allowing scientists to study weathering and geological change. [Music] [Music] Its vertical form and unusual shape made it a popular subject for photography and international film productions. [Music] with notable height, long geological history and clear formation. Old man of store is regarded as a unique natural landmark of Scotland. [Music] [Music] Vinton Gosorn. [Music] Army. [Music] Montasaria [Music] [Music] for [Music] speech. foreignolog. [Music] Ou [Music] Nika mine in Mexico is famous for containing the world's largest selonite crystals with some more than 35 ft long and weighing many tons. [Music] These crystals formed when mineralrich groundwater was heated by magma deep underground and crystallized over hundreds of thousands of years. [Music] The cave environment is extremely harsh with temperatures above 130 and nearly saturated humidity making research very difficult. [Music] Inside the mine looks like a natural crystal palace where giant columns of selonite intersect through the chamber. [Music] Nika mine is both an active mining site and a major geological discovery proving the creative power of nature. [Music] The liquid rainbow in Colombia is called the most beautiful river in the world because of a very rare natural color changing phenomenon. [Music] [Music] Red, yellow, green, black, and pink appear most clearly in the transition period between rainy and dry seasons when the water level is clear and balanced. [Music] The strange colors come from a unique aquatic plant called macarinia clavagera that grows on rocks at the bottom of the river. [Music] Oh, [Music] when sunlight shines down the mix of clear water and plant pigments creates the bright effect of a flowing rainbow. The river passes over rock layers and small waterfalls, making the scenery more dynamic and unusual. [Music] The liquid rainbow is not only a unique natural wonder but also a national symbol showing the harmony of geology, climate and special ecosystems. [Music] Navajo beach in Greece is famous for the panotaas shipwreck lying on the white sand forming a distinctive mark within the natural landscape. [Music] The beach is surrounded by white cliffs nearly 650 ft high, creating total isolation and allowing access only by sea. [Music] The seawater has a rare bright blue color produced by sunlight reflecting through white limestone at the bottom creating a clear optical effect. [Music] The contrast of white sand, high cliffs, and blue water has shaped a striking and iconic scene. [Music] Geological landslides and natural deposition continually renew the sand, preserving the beach's unique features. [Music] Navajo Beach is notable not only for its unusual beauty, but also as clear evidence of the interaction between geology, marine environment, and human impact. [Music] Monttera is one of the oldest mountains on Earth formed around 2 billion years ago during the pre-Camrian period. [Music] Its summit is flat like a giant altar covering nearly 12 square miles and surrounded by vertical cliffs over 1,300 ft high. It is made of rare tapoui sandstone slowly eroded by acid rain and strong wind over millions of years. [Music] Many natural lakes on the summit hold ancient bacteria, helping scientists study the early evolution of life. [Music] Monte Rima inspired the novel The Lost World with the idea of a land completely isolated from the outside [Music] located at a triber point. The mountain is mostly in Venezuela and seen as a sacred cultural symbol by native people and popular literature. [Music] Sotra Island in Yemen is called an otherworldly island and is famous for a unique ecosystem with more than 1/3 of plants found nowhere else. [Music] The island split from the mainland about 20 million years ago, allowing independent evolution and preserving many ancient features. [Music] Its emblem is the dragon blood tree with an inverted umbrella crown and dark red resin valued in biology and culture. [Music] Historical records note the resin was used for dye medicine and ritual writing showing long use across civilizations [Music] during windy seasons. The sand forms ridges and the trees twist in the wind, creating a moving and surreal landscape [Music] [Music] for its special geology and biology. The island is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site and a key place for biodiversity research. Behringer Crater in the United States was formed about 5,000 years ago when an iron nickel meteor about 150 ft wide struck Earth at high speed. [Music] [Music] The impact released energy equal to 10 megat tons of TNT melting rocks and throwing debris for miles. [Music] [Music] The crater measures about 3,900 ft across and nearly 600 ft deep, surrounded by a rim about 150 ft high, forming a nearly perfect circle. [Music] Many iron nickel fragments remain around the site containing rare minerals valuable for research. [Music] Behringer Crater was even used by NASA to train Apollo astronauts and today stands as a natural laboratory showing cosmic power striking our planet Lenso Marinensus National Park in Brazil. spans about 600 square miles and is famous for thousands of white dunes stretching like a giant sheet. [Music] Although it looks like a desert, the region receives heavy rainfall filling valleys between dunes with countless temporary lakes. [Music] During the rainy season, the lakes appear crystal clear, some reaching dozens of feet deep, reflecting brilliant shades of blue and turquoise. is [Music] Fish and small creatures survive because their eggs remain dormant in the And until water returns [Music] [Music] dunes rising up to 130 ft are reshaped constantly by strong winds. s making the landscape shift every season. [Music] Today, Lansois Marinenses is recognized as one of Brazil's most striking natural wonders. is [Music] Sir Vakvaten, also known as Lake Lightvaten, is the largest freshwater lake in the Farro Islands, measuring about 3 mi long and 1.3 square miles in area. [Music] The lake was formed during the ice age and sits close to the ocean yet about 100 ft higher than sea level. [Music] This elevation difference together with the horizon creates a famous optical illusion making the lake appear to float hundreds of feet above the Atlantic. [Music] Water from the lake exits through a dramatic waterfall that drops directly from steep cliffs into the ocean. Surrounding cliffs rise several hundred ft, contrasting the calm surface of the lake with the rough waves below. Today, Svag Vatin serves as both an important freshwater source and one of the most photographed natural landmarks in the Farro Islands. [Music] Pamocale in Turkey is called the cotton castle is world famous for its white travatine terraces formed by calciumrich springs over thousands of years. Small tiered pools hold turquoise water contrasting with the pure white stone and creating a surreal and unique landscape. Continuous mineral deposits reshape the travatine surface over time, making the formation dynamic and always changing. The entire slope shines white and from afar looks like a giant snowy mountain standing in a dry land. Since Roman times, the site has been used as a retreat and healing area with beliefs that mineral water could benefit health. Today, Pamokale is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site valued for its geology and as one of Turkeykey's outstanding natural wonders. [Music] Kawa Een in Indonesia is the only place on Earth with natural blue fire visible at night glowing like streams of neon blue lava. The effect happens when sulfuric gases escape from volcanic vents, meet oxygen, and ignite, producing bright blue flames. [Music] [Music] The crater also holds the largest acid lake on the planet, about 0.6 6 square miles in size with a pH close to zero strong enough to corrode metal. [Music] Its water shines bright turquoise but is extremely acidic, showing a rare contrast between beauty and danger. [Music] Thick sulfur steam rises around the vents, smelling like rotten eggs, and can burn skin or lungs without protective masks. [Music] Kawa Ain is both a unique natural wonder and a clear reminder of Earth's harsh and mysterious forces. [Music] Victoria Falls is one of the largest and most powerful waterfalls on Earth with a height over 350 ft and a width close to 1 mile forming a massive wall of water. [Music] During the rainy season, it can carry over 15,000 gallons per minute, creating a thick mist cloud visible from more than 12 m away. Locals call it moi oatuna, meaning the smoke that thunders because of the roaring sound and columns of spray rising hundreds of feet into the air. [Music] What makes Victoria Falls unique is its vertical drop from a flat rock ledge. Unlike most waterfalls that follow a mountain slope, [Music] the flow appears suddenly sliced from the land, creating a dramatic illusion as if the river disappears into the void. [Music] It is a place where sound, mist water, and light come together to form one of nature's greatest spectacles. [Music] Petra in Jordan was carved directly into red sands\r\n",

         "Meet Sims Patton, a PhD candidate at The George Washington University doing her research out of Gombe Stream Research Center in Tanzania! 🤩🔍\n🌿🐵 Gombe Stream Research Center is where Dr. Jane Goodall began her work in 1960. Though her interest in primates started young, Sims's Gombe journey began decades later in 2021, when she joined the Primate Behavioral Ecology Lab at The George Washington University.\n🌳📊 Now a fifth year PhD candidate, Sims recently completed her first field season at Gombe, officially marking her name in the Gombe record forever! She also gathered some pretty exciting stories, including a few run-ins with siafu, otherwise known as safari ants. 🐜\n🧐💭 Looking ahead to the future of Gombe research, Sims wonders how climate change will impact chimpanzee habitat and behaviors: \"Will temperature and rainfall impact the fruit trees there? Will the chimps resort to eating more fallback foods like leaves and grasses?” We're counting on Gombe researchers like Sims to keep seeking answers to these questions! 🌟\nMeet more of Gombe's researchers on our blog >> https://news.janegoodall.org/2025/07/11/voices-of-gombe-a-network-of-impact/\n📸 credit: Sims Patton\n#Gombe #ChimpanzeeResearch #ChimpanzeeConservation #Primatology #ChimpanzeeBehavior #PrimateBehavior #Researcher",

I remain your host Ruth Esamu and as you know, every morning my ladies and I come your way with the headlines. Joining me in the studios this morning is Miss Regina Bless and Miss Debo. Good morning. Good morning. How are you doing, Miss Deb? The grace is sufficient. We bless God. How are you doing, Miss Regina? I'm good. You? Yeah, I'm fine. Hope you're anticipating for the weekend. Cuz I see you already in the weekend for you. You are ahead of us already. Yeah, it is what it is. She's already ahead of us. I know, right? you just come and see something. All right, you're welcome to the news headline review. So, let's dive straight into our major news items for this morning. Education Ministry rolls out PTAs nationwide with new guidelines. The Ministry of Education has announced nationwide rollout of parent teacher associations under a new framework designed to strengthen collaboration between schools and families. The announcement followed the submission of final policy guidelines on the operationalization of PTAs developed by the National Curriculum Review Committee. Education Minister Haruna urged parents and teachers to work together to improve learning outcomes, stressing that education is a shared responsibility. He said PTAs are back. Now there is an established norm with guidelines to facilitate and support their work. Socialization is a shared responsibility particularly for young learners while the child spends time at home. Significant hours are spent in school making both parents and teachers equally responsible for shaping the child. Ghana's concept of socialization must be shared. Chairman of the committee on the guidelines, Kofi Assari, emphasized that PTAs must play an active role in school level decision making rather than being seen merely as fundraisers. Guidelines seek to prevent PTAs from being reduced to contributors or funds. their key role must be participation in decisions to improve teaching and learning outcomes. He explained the scope of PTAs in school development has now been tailored more towards involvement in learning and decision making processes. Mr. Sari also called on the Ghana education service to ensure the effective implementation of the guidelines and that was coming from the ministry of education and the committee for PTA which is Mr. Assari and Hara Idrisu and the Ministry of Education has officially rolled out PTAs across Ghana with new guidelines to strengthen the partnership between parents and teachers. And now the aim to make PTAs active in decision making about teaching and learning instead of focusing on only fundraising. Most of the times when you go to schools parents don't even have a say all they need to do is pay your PTA dues and they're gone. Now they've brought in new guidelines and the education minister Har Niguio stressed that education is a shared responsibility while the committee chair Kofi Asar noted that the new framework will help PTAs contribute more meaningfully to school development. So now back to you my ladies. Do you think PTA will, you know, allow our parents to really have a say when it comes to, you know, learning and teaching and learning rather than just being fundraisers? Messina. Okay. So, I would say for a very long time, parents have been fundraisers. They are um parents have been fundraisers. There are people who only contribute financially to the institution and to the welfare of their kids without involving themselves. And I think this is really bad. It got to a point I was questioning myself why is it so? Because in every school all the teachers are supposed to make sure that they include the um the parents and that is how it's supposed to be. I can't remember way back in JHS if your parent does not come for PTA you would be punished. You'll be punished and after being punished you pay for the fine. Exactly. And when this parent comes to the school they make sure whatever complaint that the teacher has. Why is everything okay at homework? What is happening? the teachers are doing their part and it's also up to the parents to also do their part. So when it comes to SHS and they are excluding the parents from the organization or from the welfare of the kids, I I think that it shouldn't be so. Mhm. So I'm very happy that they've implemented it again and it should come with um a more relevant solution. It shouldn't only be about money money because some some schools or some organizations in as much as they're including the parents they only including them for financial sake. That's how it was formally and it was very bad. Exactly. It shouldn't be like that. They should make sure that the parents also have a say because as you read most of the kids in fact all the kids spend a larger part of their lives in school. In school exactly so if they are not really including their the parents I think in a way it's bad so they should include them and make sure that they feel it and have impact. Yeah. Miss Evie, how do you think these new guidelines are going to be enforced in these schools rather than making parents fundraisers as Miss Regina said that if the school is facing a challenge or when they they embarking on a new project that is when they remember that oh the the the parents of these students are even there we can utilize them to raise fund. Should that be the case in the first place? No, it shouldn't be the case. But let me rectify this. Not all schools actually not all PTAs in some schools do that. I mean they wait till maybe um the school is lacking something and they need the what's the name they need the help of the parents and then they have to contribute them. No, the school I went PTA they don't only discuss about money money sometimes about the wealth of the student and I think sometime ago we were discussing this sometimes they discuss about your studies the PTA is about the studies of the student and then they they they bring your result me the school I went from DHS to senior high school your dad is sitting here then they hand the your report card to your dad Right. And my dad is not someone who I would say he's not educated. My dad he knows everything. So he's there and then they try to um help parents who are not too well educated in terms of the the grading and stuffs and then they tell your word that this is it. When your your word get this he or she is not performing and then they tell you. So some schools they don't only base on like money money money money but it's because I feel like 90% of some schools do that and for PCM they want to buy definitely you have to pay you have to pay some amount of money but now that they they are going to normalize it again I feel like it is good and then with the aspect of you saying the money but then it is more important when we focus more on wellbeing or the welfare of the student because the student assistance is your property as a parent. Whatever becomes of that child comes straight to you as a parent. Whether what comes out of that child is positive, you are going to benefit. Whether it comes out to be negative, it will still come back to hand to you. So when you go to PTM meetings, I feel like some schools should engage those schools that do not engage parents when it has to do with their study, they should start doing it. And so any fort if you know that like you didn't do well and sometimes the teachers will come and tell you in the face when your parents come and they will tell them the true fact. So they contribute to the wealth of the student. Sometimes they even tell the the the parents what you're supposed to get. Maybe oh she's not or he's not too good in studies. This is what is going to help. But if you still insist that you want him or her to study and be in school, then you have to get maybe a private teacher at home and then you lessen you lessen the activities of the child at home so you can focus on your books. So I feel like those schools who depend so much on money man money they should start I mean coming up and with the question you're asking me how we are going to do it I feel like we should get someone who monitor this PTA meetings who is coming directly from like the GES and then they come up like around monitoring their meetings see how it's It's good. You're supposed to contribute and then the child is supposed to be in a conducive environment. So he or she can study but aside that what's next? Because conducive environment at the end of the answer. So in as much as we want a conducive environment, you should also think about the child as well the the the improvement when it has to do with studies. So those schools they should start backing up until we when we want them to back up the best thing we can do is monitor them. Monitor them. Yes. Monitor them. I remember when I was in school whenever they call for PTA meetings my heart. That's the time our parent\r\n",

         "Should Christians take part in politics—or stay away from it? 🤔\nIn this episode of the iTiS Thursday Weekly Katchup (John 4:24), we dive into one of the most debated topics: The Role of a Christian in National Politics.\nThrough Scripture and real-world reflections, we explore:\n💭 Jeremiah 29:7 → Should Christians actively seek the peace and prosperity of their nation?\n💭 Acts 1:15–26 → If Spirit-filled believers once cast lots, should Christians today participate in voting?\n💭 1 Peter 4:10 → Are our gifts only for the Church—or also for serving our nation?\n💭 Matthew 5:13–16; Colossians 4:6 → What does it mean to be the “salt and light” in politics?\n💭 Matthew 28:18–20; Romans 13:1–7 → If both the Church and the State belong to God, how should they work together?\n💭 From Joseph, Daniel, Esther, Nehemiah, and Cornelius → Were they just believers, or also political leaders?\n👉 This discussion challenges us to rethink faith, governance, and the believer’s responsibility in shaping society.\n🗓 Recorded live during the iTiS Thursday Weekly Katchup.\n🔔 Don’t forget to like, share, and subscribe for more engaging conversations from the iTiS Well of Worship Fellowship.\n#ChristianPolitics #FaithAndSociety #BibleStudy #iTiSKatchup #KingdomInfluence",

For those of you who are in East Africa, this is in truth and in spirit world of worship fellowship. It is a Thursday and every Thursday we have a weekly catch up where we have sometimes a Q&R questions and responses and other days we have uh uh topical discussions and today since it is a Thursday uh we are going to discuss the role of a Christian in in national politics our role. So we'll be um investigating whether Christians have something to do in about national politics, whether they should participate in where they shouldn't. Uganda is u is heading to to the elections of 2026. Uh the candidates were picking their nominations and so far I think uh three of them or four of them have been approved. That's president [Music] of common man's party is Robert of National Platform has picked his paper. Then uh General Mugishamu has also picked his party from the anti- alliance of national transformation. I think that's the party. And then there is also another new in front and mir the old one also has also picked his papers I guess. Uh they there are eight in number for Uganda I think now others I think have not been approved. So Uganda is heading into an election. So our topic this uh this week is is asking our our role as Christians. Should we participate? Shouldn't we? Among those that have picked their papers, President Musevani is seemingly an Anglican who is not a regular Anglican. The head of late is here. He will tell us the quality of the membership of President Mus in the Anglican church whether he's a regular member or an absentee member. You will tell us Zen Robert is a Catholic who also known regular in the Catholic church. I don't know his denomination and so is Miri and Mua is a Muslim and is a regular and in good standing as as as a Muslim because he he observes all the brilliant. So, so we are we asking uh this Thursday the following questions. Should Christians seek peace and the flourishing of their society later on their country through whatever necessary and applicable means? What we mean here is uh historically President Musevan went to the to the bush and fought a sitting government and overthrew it. An elected government and overthrew it. And he was celebrated by all the cultural institutions and the religious institutions by that act. And when we asked those religious institutions why they celebrated that rebel who overthrew a legit government, a government that was elected by the people, they gave two reasons. First, the elected government had become evil against its people. Number two, u they said that it was justifiable to fight evil. So in other words, should Christians physically and with ammunitions fight evil, an evil government and overthrow it or unseat it? Is it the right? Is it the Christian thing to do? I have a verse for that. That's Jeremiah 29:7. You guys today, I'm not going to read those verses. You read those verses and then they'll help you. So should Christians seek peace and uh and the flourishing of their society? By all means necessary. In other words, for the purposes of this context and this discussion. If the leader is is corrupt, should we stand against that leader as a Christian to make sure that we solve the problem of corruption? Yes or no? Why? Number two, we'll be asking now that a group of believers filled with the Holy Spirit cast lots, should the Christians participate in voting? And you guys, I know a number of you who do not want to vote. One of them, I am not shy to mention him. This one is my brother. Jethro doesn't want to vote. I don't remember the last time he cast a vote. And there are many who look like him. Okay. So, should Christians participate in voting? All right. And there is a scripture for that. Acts 1 verse 15- 16 verse 15- 26 where the disciples had to cast votes or a lot to determine who was going to replace Judah the betrayer. Okay. Number three, we'll be asking, are believers only gifted to serve in church and not for their country? Because according to the Bible, there are those who are gifted with interpreting languages, those who have gifts of healing, apostles. Some are apostles, others are prophets, others are preachers, others are pastors, others, you know, you know those those those gifts of the Holy Spirit. So does the Holy Spirit gift us to only work in the church local and not even work in our and work for our country? Our gifts for church are not for country. Okay. So we'll be we'll be addressing that also as well. And I have a verse for that. 1 Peter verse 4:10. You guys ready for that? We are late. That's why I'm rushing. Number four will be also asking how are Christians the salt and the light of the of politics. Can we be the salt and light of politics? Now that we castigate politics is a dirty game de because you Christians have not sanitized it. You who are not dirty. So shouldn't you who are clean involve yourself into a dirty business and cleanse it from its dirt and flavor it now that pastors because recently there was a bishop in in northern Uganda who who rebuked President Musev someone should look for that audio by the way Jethro you should look for that that audio I think is in audio or video something he was from northern Uganda he rebuked president and told him I'm going to tell Tell you what others do not want or fear to tell you. Number one, you are wrong to overstay in power. Number two, those who are telling you that your government is safe. They are lying to you. All governments have fallen apart. You need to start working for your people and helping them. You have abused Ugandans. Someone should look for that bishop and share that uh that thing with us. Jethro and Andrew Tana, please look for that bishop. Now, so was that bishop being the salt of uh of politics and the light to the darkness in politics or not? Should is that how Christians should participate in in politics? I have a verse for that. Matthew 5:3-16. And then does both okay. Okay. Doesn't both the church which is here to preach the gospel and nature faith and the state which is here to maintain order punish evil and promote justice doesn't both belong to God and shouldn't they work hand in hand okay because in uh in the stud of politics there's the doctrine of the church and the state where some politicians argue that these must be distinct members and they serve different purposes at a certain point President backlash at religious leaders told them, \"You do your work and let me do my work. Leave politics for me. Concentrate on preaching the gospel.\" Was the president right in that? Okay. The regious council is always trying to engage the politicians to see how the religious council in Uganda at least to see how services can reach the the populace. Shouldn't the state and the church work together or hand in hand or these are just distinct entities that cannot cooperate for the betterment of of of the country. All right, I have a verse for that. Romans chapter 13 verse 17 and Matthew chapter 28 to 20. Finally. Amen. Where people like uh the centurion in Matthew 85:13, Cornelius in Acts 10, Nehemiah in Nehemiah 1 and 2, Esther the queen of Persia in Esther 4:4, Joseph in Genesis 41, and Daniel in the book of Daniel. where these people just Christians or more of politicians. This is what we'll be discussing today. You're welcome. This is in truth and in spirit well of worship fellowship. It is a non-denominational fellowship. We engage thoughts here. We provoke your thinking. We discuss all matters. For us, we think that politics is our business as Christians at it. That's why we discuss politics. But we make sure that we flavor our discussions of politics with the will and the word of God to make sure that we don't run into unnecessary battles. May God bless you as you participate into this in Jesus name. Amen. Okay. Who wants to go? Who wants who wants to go first? The man your mic is on. Is that intentional or? Hey. Yes. Uh I was driving I was driving so I just left it on so that I don't have to keep that. That's all right. Then you want to go first sir anywhere? Yeah. Uh uh from from how you've introduced it I'm going first of all say that Christians are not any different from uh other human beings. We we are the same. And uh if politics is to affect it affects us in the same way how it affects other people who are not Christian. So uh if it calls for participation we're supposed to part or we are obliged to participate like any other human being. We are not any special any special breed. Uh that will be my first point. Now the second one I'll bring the the aspect of Uganda uh the the point of religion and politics and I'll bring it in the historical perspect the the context of history uh how does religion and politics come in here now before before the politics and the religion that we have here we already had religion and politics that was at play just that uh that now it is a bit different when the white men when the white men came here in the 19th century. Uh if you recall very well the explorers came then in 19 in 1975 uh that this Henry Martin Stanley wrote a letter where they said that Kabaka wrote requesting for for Christians to come and they eventually came after two years in 1877. the church missionary society Christians came and then the Roman Catholic also came and then and eventually the religion entered what entered Uganda and it spread across across the the whole of Uganda. Now when the region came the politics also came because after after the region had come the missionaries laid the foundation for the for colonization. So the missionaries came in 1877. They they put up uh they first of all they indoctrinated uh they inoculated the natives they found here uh by convincing them that whatever they woriing was devilish was black was bad and they introduced a better god who was white uh a better worship system and uh in doing that they also weakened the traditional leadership because before they came here we already had politics Yeah. And this politics was mainly monarchies which was Uganda which was in Koreo to those were the the strong ones. Then we also had the chiefts as you all know. Now when they came they first of all weakened our traditional systems, the religion and then eventually they weakened the the political system where they ended up arresting the the most powerful kings that was cover and at the peak of it all remember even before arresting them was it before after the religious wars after arresting them and taking them into exile now they remove that that politic of monarchism and now there's a virtue. So in in 187 in 1894 Uganda is declared the protectorate. Now it's being taken over by the British who ruled up to 1962. Now why I'm bringing all this history is that uh the British brought their politics here the democracy that you can choose a leader. Yet for us Africans we didn't have that. Okay. We we we we knew that leadership was was was you could become a leader by birth. Like if if your father fought and uh took over the the amount of from from uh his brothers then that means that leadership is going to be flowing through the blood but not through the bar the bar the bar. So these guys came rolled us for probably let's say 70 years then when they leaving they said now leadership is going to go through what it's going to be going through the the the box which was which actually is not which is actually not and I'm just referring to the case of because we can say that we have had three presidents the first president came in the one that the British left here of course with the games they played They had to make sure that a Catholic which also brings in that aspect of religion a Catholic who had who had been voted into power they had to play their tricks and kick him out. I'm talking about then they brought in an Anger they left here but that Angan leader was removed from power then eventually then he was also removed again then seven comes in now now this guy who comes in seven now goes back to the tradition the mindset of an African that when I get power remember power is like what we have said in in this Ugandan context It's so you can say that somehow came through the bar but of course the bar of 1961 the the Catholics will not agree and the DP will not agree that actually it was legit. So you have who comes and becomes a true leader like how his ancestors were. You come into leadership, you rule. After ruling and after you died, you leave it your son. And uh but try trying to consolidate what the white man what the westerners shattered. Ahu. Yes. Try to cons but on this side the westerners are telling you that you have to be voting every 5 years. And the man is like okay it's okay. Let's keep voting. But the reality is that if you not being coerced that voting will not be there and we are talking about Uganda, you go to Rwanda, go to southern Sudan, go to the other time Sudan of Bash, go to I think most most countries in Africa are like that. leadership is is leadership is uh okay politics in Africa we are still our mindset is still in that thing of of how the monarchies operate so and which is not which is and I want you to emphasize that it is not right to demonize our monarchical order of leadership and praise the the western democracy I don't think that theirs theirs was better than us. It could have been better for them and ours was actually actually better for us. Yes. And you see uh when you look at at at Britain which coronized us, they have a leader who has the one who has absolute powers is is the monarchy. Yes. Then they have this prime minister they keep changing and that prime minister probably has I don't know about the administrative if Francis was here was going to tell us how powerful the prime minister is but the real power is held in that family and and they don't vote for that family. Now when you ask should a Christian be involved me I'll go back and say that uh because our system was disorganized and now we are we are using the system that is not real. So how how can a Christian be involved in this uh in quotes the so-called democracy which is actually not really democracy but we have to participate. I would say that a Christian should take a lukewarm position because I literally even if you participate there's nothing much you're going to change you started by telling us that Christians are not special they as affected as non-Christians with by politics. So why shouldn't a Christian in what actually affects them? Now because you see when you participate the participation of the Christian is the 1981 February 6th of getting a gun and you go and fight a regime. So if you want to participate as a Christian then you can do that here in Uganda or you go on the streets they shoot they shoot and probably you do what Sudan did the Sudan did that is the participation but as I let you go in again in your submission I was following you closely you said that somehow somewhere president has managed to smuggle monarchism into the western democracy and that's why in power can't we Christian values into this sin darkened politics and then we flavor it with what is right at the same time I mean at that level participation not fighting physically not having all those ammunitions not having these strikes on the streets but at least participating in a very logical and sensible way to try to sanize this politics now My my my okay my argument is uh you see the the the the difference between uh I I I'll I'll borrow UK where I've been talking about the power is in uh it's in the monarchy then I'll also look at an example of Kenya and Tanzania where the leaders and Arab Moy decided to give people power. Okay. Now, it was the intention of the leader to give people power. And that is why in in Kenya and in in Tanzania, we see something that is that is a bit there's some democracy because the president does not have absolute powers. their leader their leaders and and gave away that power. Now if all the leader that comes after him does not do that then we are lying to ourselves that we can change anything with with this participation in the political exercise. until that until that thing that time happens and we have a leader who has agreed to give power to the people then there we have the power to choose but until that and and if that thing hadn't happened in Kenya up to now if Moya decided to to rule them the way you wanted to rule would not be having this change of leadership like it's happening or if decided not to to to give away power it would also still like Uganda. Okay. Really? Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Uh our resident psychologist Dave on the mic. Can you say hello? Hey Dave, is that you? All right. Uh still switching on his mic. Arion, are you well? Are you driving or you? No. No. I am well. I'm well. I'm well. I'm well. I'm well and listening in. That's all right. Uhhuh. Jessica, Jessica, you're welcome. It's good to have you here, my sister. Keep following. All right. Uh uh. Ah, I have lost I have lost Jet. I've lost Jet now. Okay. Uh any any person who wants to come in at this point? Noisy background with Dave. You cannot. Okay. I hope you can hear us with that noisy background still. If you can hear us, that's all right. you keep texting us so that we can follow your your thoughts. So, so Arong, do you think as a Christian you should participate in uh in politics or it is a dirty a dirty game to for us Christians to avoid. I personally think that uh in order for me to be a Christian, I must be in this world. Yes. where there is that all over. So, so saying a Christian should not participate in politics is is being doile and lazy because politics has has has has has very many faces. In in in friendship there is politics. In marriage there is politics. there is this other mainstream politics of ruling a country nations. So, so, so, so before we can say Christians should not participate in the politics or they should participate in politics, we need to appreciate the fact that Christians are well and aware that they are in this world where politics matters, where political beliefs matter. After all, even Jesus is a politician. He's in politics. He's a little different from ours, but he is. Thank you. Brilliant. Brilliant. That's that's that's very helpful. Uh you have actually reminded us that uh a human being is a political animal. uh uh majority of uh their sociology is is is politics. Marriage is about is playing politics. Uh family is a political arena. Uh work work spaces there's the politics of the workspace. There's the politics on the street. Okay. I think that's very interesting. And then the other thing also to emphasize is that uh if if if you don't want to involve yourself into political affairs, politics will involve itself into your personal affairs. So it is better that you the best way in football we say that the best way to defend is to attack. We argue that it is a little bit better to to involve yourself into politics before politics involves itself into the affairs of your life. That that's brilliant. Governor 17, are you there? Can you talk or you are far away? Can you say hello? Yes, I can say hello. And I don't know how is the noise. Okay, that you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. In case you want to say something, you you come up and say something. I just wanted to congratulate you that in these campaigns we have a Muslim candidate Mubarak. So Islam is one of the political figures that we have in this country. But is Uganda a religious country? No, Uganda is not a religious country. But we are trying to demonstrate how religion can participate in politics. So when we get these religious people participating in politics, we celebrate them. For instance, for instance, President is an Anglican. I don't know whether he's in good standing with the Anglican. Oh, okay. So but the head of here you can tell us whether president is still in the register. I have been told that who is in in the Anglican church she was made a canon recently yes so we have Canon who is the minister of energy. So I think religious people should participate in politics by all means and I think having a canon in the ministry of energy has actually boosted our ministry of energy and is performing because we have what are you what are you laughing about and Isaiah yes that guy the seventh day who was the president of was it was it Marawi or I think Marawi Zambia Zambia Zambia Yeah. Did he lose? Hasn't he lost? I don't know whether he lost the second term. I have not checked yet. Cuz they voted. I think they voting. The one from the one from the one who lost and the other one got 57%. Yeah, I think he lost. But I'm told he was very corrupt with his SDA church with his religious beliefs. then. So basically what you saying Christians are not the light to politics because they look like the politics or yo you are trying to say that uh because uh Robert had a complaint that religious leaders have not helped the struggle because uh the sitting government bribes them with cars and what and they cannot speak their mind and some of them actually have demonstrated that the religious council has also been accused that is not doing their role because president has distributed cars among those religious leaders and the most influential ones. So they are not doing their role of being the sort of politics and the light of the dark politics is and then you came up with that example of that corrupt religious leader of of Zambia. I don't know whether you talk about the Zambian 7th Adventist or the Malawian born again because the for Malawi it was it was a born again. Yes. I'm going I'm going to Google I'm going to Google it's called if that is that is Zambia. I think that is Zambia. Good. Brilliant. So yes. So uh people here can't talk unfortunately. So we are we are trying to ask ourselves we are openminded. Let them we shall not judge them. We are trying to to to ask ourselves how we can better participate in uh as Christians and by we I mean Christians. How can Christians participate in uh in uh in this in this whole thing? Now uh now that I would like to ask you was prophet Muhammad just religious leader or also a political leader and a revolutionary is a leader and a leader means politics. Oh yeah. Because when you look at when you look at the history of Islam etc. you you don't only see God but you also see the politics at play. and how you organize those Arab countries. And actually if in my opinion if one wants to separate politics and this political groups or religions I think that person is is is missing something because it's uh it's it's politics that has has ruled everything everything in the history of uh human beings. things. But I'm told that uh before before Constantine uh religion and politics were separate. You you had the kings then you also had the the religious people. It is it is this Constantine that comes and and uses them. But but you see but you see I mean when when you go back to that history that where you want to go you will have the struggle to separate monarchism with theocracy. I think monarchism was just a hand of the theocracy. Kings were we are ruling on behalf of the gods. So there was no point when there was no point in history when the church and the state were separate entities. It is these westerners who actually came up with that whole idea that the the church and state should be should be separated. But even when you go back to our indigenous religions, a religion at at its primitive stage, you will see that the pharaohs were representatives of the gods. The kings in Israel, for those of you who are Bible readers, we are representative of the gods. Muhammad is killing and in and in all his jihad wars organizing those Arab nations he's killing in the name of Allah and he's saving and say redeeming others believers in the name of Allah that's why I asked whether you can separate Muhammad from politics can you separate David the most popular king of the Bible from politics and religion at the same time then when you come back here uh let me talk on behalf of the Waganda who are not here today. At least the dev who is here cannot speak but uh the the Kabaka Mui is is the representative of the gods of Buganda and that is that was our leadership. So you can see that significantly the church and the state are one and the same thing here. They wanted the same thing. But but recently we had uh we we had Exactly. So So our our setting of of monarchism was was almost a hand or a branch of of a theocracy. You see? So, so, so for me, for me, I really think that whole idea of you can separate church and state, I don't it is just it is also another politics to to make sure that the values that the religious leaders are going to to to share won't gag the corruption and the deception and the deceit of politics that want to be exercised. For me, I think that's that's that's the whole idea. And when you go to the United States, Trump was voted in religiously. The conservatives are the religious again the most religious. So you can see that the church had had a contribution largely to the success of uh of Trump. Back here in Uganda, we had a war between uh my elder brother, General Moes Kerugaba and and Shik Chitti. I don't know whether you guys have been following Shik Chitti. She shik Chitti is is a Muslim cleric and he keeps uh he he keeps showing his side. He he's a supporter toi and because the the politics in Uganda has been abused to the level of offense and defense to show that you you you hate muse you have to offend him which I disagree with and to show that you love you have to offend the city government. So he's been doing that thing like that. Then recently uh general as usual and I and I like what he's doing by the way uh he communicated through ex through his exhandle okay and said she if you don't stop that nonsense I will come for you and you will tell me if you don't stop attacking the king of Uganda and by the king of Uganda yes and by the king of Uganda I guess he meant Uh my father, my one and only father, President Musef and she in his next presentation started saying He was actually Yes. So the guy chickened out and did what? But [Laughter] was doing it in the wrong way. Okay. But again, how how how better would would have participated in the politics? Because why why do you have to why do you have to threaten Shei? Why? And why don't you appreciate the correction from Shikh Chitti? Then to Shikh Chitti, I ask why do you have to attack and insult meaning that any time the president might die? Why why do you have to use that angle of insult and not use a a professional way and a better way? I mean, why don't you be the the light? Why why don't you shed light on the darkness of politics instead of shedding darkness on the darkness of politics by insults? I think I think as as as religious people that's what we we need to do. Any good uh any person who wants to to share with us? Yes. Is there? Yes. Uh I want to I want to come back to to to where I stopped. uh in in in in the 1970s we we had D bishop who was eventually killed in 1977 and uh they say that he was you used to criticize the the government of but on the same hand there's also another cardinal for the for the for the Roman Catholic church who was called Emanuel And uh for him he was not he was not murdered. But uh in they say from what history or from from the Israel read he was also equally very very very he used to criticize a means government but for him his criticism was stopping on what on the pullpit and I think he had he had he was using the pullpit effectively by by criticizing what Amin was doing the same thing that uh that uh that uh this guy was also doing uh room. But uh the the what happened is that uh uh okay maybe this is to drag you to some history but but people say that the state research bureau did some intelligence and indeed there are some reverence that were shipping guns from Tanzania and that is why R was killed. R was not killed because he was criticizing with his mouth. room was killed because for him he had taken the the war physically by by engaging what by engaging arms. Now that's why I said if if you're a Christian and you want to engage uh for example this because this is a military you know that is one thing that we fail to understand this is a government that is being led by rebels. There's a time when talking about you look at a guy like he started fighting when you were 16. He started and when you talk about fighting we're talking about killing people. He started seeing death. In fact even his nickname they say that he was called Rufu. He started seeing death when he was 16 years. Okay. So you can imagine his entire life he he he doesn't he has no life that there's one that died I think two years ago with one eye there are so many generals that are living where they say they have then also even the president himself is a former rebel leader now I want you to understand the people that are leading us and then you tell them that a bar can take them away for you shouting as a as a river that you go or like you just go and start saying those things and think that such things can move a man who started seeing death at 16 years. So that's why if you involve yourself as a Christian, you have to involve yourself as if you have a get guns and try to fight against this government because this government the only language they can hear is the language the sound of a gun. Period. Yes. But but you see with or without the gun I think we can as Christians we can still participate in uh in politics. Uh we might leave the guns for them since they are gunmen and then also negotiate our our role also because we still have a role to play. Uh it's not the gun negotiating. It's not negotiating. Yeah I know. Yeah I know. Yes, you can negotiate Rufu. You can you can negotiate Ruf because now Rufu sits in Rufus sits in Capeek and sits in northern Uganda. Then Rufu calls calls the parliament to where he is. Uh but you can negotiate Rufu about the health care if you are the minister of health and tell him we need this and these drugs. You can negotiate with Rufu about good roads. You can negotiate with Rufu about education system. You know, as long as Rufu is in charge, you can negotiate these other things. But I think we Christians also have been lazy. We have not participated because look at uh you are the historian here. Look at Idiamin and the other guy whom we the Jenn Yes. You can see that the jans were were making some noise really. They were making some noise but the silence and the indifference by the modern religious leaders is also scary in one way or another. I think we can do better than what we we are doing. So this whole thing of these are these formers etc etc. Yes, they are granted. But uh does can evil stop us from out of our houses? I don't think so. We should get actually what what we should stop is from religion you know uh to involve ourselves in in in in the politics because take an example of Congo and when you take when you take an example of Congo, Congo is full of uh I think Christians uh that are you know ruling the the government. I mean they decide who comes in and uh it has been all priests, it's been chefs been religious leaders who have you know luggages that are not allowed you know by the governments and and so forth. I think it's uh it's religious leaders who have put themselves into this and there's no way they can you know you can say no I'm a religious leader I'm just helping some people to overthrow the government I would kill more if I was part of the government I would everything and and I th...",

Many return home injured, traumatized, or in some cases never make it back. Two Kenyans are reported to have recently returned with one currently admitted to Kenyata National Hospital. The construction of the regional maritime and shipping logistics training center at the cost of 1 billion shillings in the remote village of W in Quali County is almost complete. Education CS Jula made the announcement during World Maritime Day celebrations at the Kenya Maritime Authority headquarters in Mombasa. Kenya government with the support from the World Bank under the East Africa skills for transformation and regional integration project has been developing a model training school for maritime transport and port logistics at W in Qual County. This premier facility operating as a compass of the Kenya Coast National Poly Technic is now 94% complete and will be ready to register trainees as early as January next year. The center is expected to admit over 1,500 students from Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Agamba also emphasized the need for stakeholders in the maritime sector to identify skill gaps and skills gaps and align training with industry demands. It is essential to engage with industry stakeholders, listening to their needs, understanding their skill gaps and aligning our curriculum with the realities of the sector. Together we can ensure that our graduates are job ready and equipped to contribute meaningfully to the maritime industry's growth and transformation. The government of Kenya through the Ministry of Education remains steadfast in his commitment to investing in education, skills development and infrastructure that will drive sustainable economic growth. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas has said he's ready to work with world leaders to implement a peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians announced by France on Monday. Speaking via video at the UN General Assembly, Abbas reiterated his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm. He also called on countries which had not yet recognized a Palestinian state to do so and for the UN to grant it full membership. Abbas denounced Israel's military offensive in Gaza, accusing it of committing one of the most horrific humanitarian tragedies of the 20th and 21st centuries. But he said he rejected the actions of Hamas in its acts in its attack on Israel on October 7th, 2023. That's the news. I'm Edwin Lisamira. 102.5 Spice FM Kisumu. The following takes place from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every weekday on Spice FM. In this country, six families and 8,000 kgans control 90% of the GDP. We are not a country. We are a plantation. We work for R. When you're telling the judges court orders are papers or they will not obey court orders, they're sitting and you're seeking orders from them. So, how are they supposed to interpret it? Isn't it an oxymoron? When you see a judiciary that seems to be under some control somewhere, you start questioning. We have very powerful governors, but they don't use their offices to serve the people. If you are not shameful to do what you are doing, why should we protect you? I'm human. Everybody's human. So when you're told I mean you'd be a fool to conversations have to be had. You know people in leadership should only go into leadership if they are ready and willing to change the lot of the people. The situation board Kenya's biggest conversation. If we just gloss over issues and hope that time gals, then we may find that in generations to come we might be back at the same situation. And the whole thing is born of stolen elections. When it comes to the decisions you make, you must be independent. There's no way you can allow one institution to dictate to you how you're going to conduct your operations, how you're going to decide cases. It's a no. When you weaken the institution to the point where they cannot take action, then you realize that politicians have to come up and now start dealing with the issues. That conversation has to die. Our politicians do not like the hard stuff. We must insist on the path of doing things right whether popular or unpopular. Money changes hands. That is a fact. If you have political goodwill at the highest top like in Rwanda, then corruption will be an issue of the past. If you don't have political goodwill at the top, we will pass laws. We will amend laws. We will continue passing laws and be amending laws and nothing will happen. This is the situation rule. The only way to start your day. One of the things that are in our country is negative ethnicity. You find you as a state officer. Instead of thinking as a Kenyan, you think like a tribal person. Let me tell you something. The biggest problem we have had in this country is a leadership deficit. There is nothing that you are going to do in the process of change if you are not a risk taker. So you really have to pursue your vision to a logical conclusion and even be ready to step on people's toes. When it comes to the economy, you can run away with it. They say statistics are like bikinis. They reveal a lot, but they conceal the vitals. And so government people would would would throw statistics at you and tell you they're revealing a lot of information to you, but it's really concealing the real vitals. We need to get out of that because when we want to grow our democracy, one basic thing that really requires to be understood by the political class, by all of us, is institutions are critical. This is the situation room. The only way to start your day. Good morning and I love your show. Thank you. Thank you. Having come from a Kikuyu radio background, I migrated to Spice because of the content. I was born in Islam, but somehow I got a break in life. So sometimes when you see the sweating coming out because of the passion and whatever it is behind the noise, there are people and we share the same umbilical cord. It shouldn't be like that. I am so disappointed. We used to tell honorable that he's doing police of cornmanship and even president you cannot promise people that we reduce tax then you double in politics there is the issue of trust for you to turn around and then stab the same people who gave you that trust there is no other level of dishonesty the situation board Kenya's biggest conversation If we just gloss over issues and hope that time gals, then we may find that in generations to come, we might be back at the same situation. And the whole thing is born of stolen elections. When it comes to the decisions you make, you must be independent.

Mornings done right. 94.4 for Spice FM Nairobi. Good morning and uh good morning. Let me arrange myself in the chair before I fall down. Good morning. Good morning again. Good morning. Well done. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. I am alive and everything is shaping up. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I am assuming that it's a good thing. Yeah. Everything is okay. Yeah. Everything is okay. Nice. I think I overslept and then that's why I'm feeling tired. Is it possible to be tired from tired that you're tired is tired? Is it possible? Is that state of mind? I don't know. But like now if you can tell me indu come just come here. Lie down here. Close your eyes. Close the curtains. Just sleep. I cannot refuse. It's in your life. I cannot refuse. It's Friday. It's Friday. I know. And the weekend's here. So, we're getting into things. I'm glad to know that you're fine. Uh, so Friday and uh and Dennis with you. Uh, the other Dennis Okari is in Pakistan.

So, uh, with that, we'll have a couple of conversations today, and let me tell you what that will be in just a bit. When we say good morning to Eevee E, she's looking all floral with pink around her neck. And, uh, Jolene has been looking for coffee. Oh, look at that. She has even done the tan. I know Eve E. Shocking people every day. Uh, somebody please help Jolene and find coffee. Um, because she's not doing okay, guys. She's not okay. Mirani, Mr. Mirani. Mirani to the rescue. It's not okay. Uh today, I'm sorry, but the Kofia did not show up. Uh we were trying to see how we can make things work, but Christina has disappointed us gravely. Yeah. But uh she'll still try to make sure that you see the shows through the day. So those are the people who are doing things in the background. Rio came to the office today and then did not want to do his work. We are reporting him on national radio and TV and letting the world know that he has declined his duties. You know what would say? Yeah. So, good morning everybody and welcome. This is the situation room. It's Kenya's biggest conversation and Dennis here with you today as we get into things. There's som\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nвыс zoom\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:system. So, I'm glad to be here with you all and I'll pass the mic to Lance. Hi everyone. I am the founder and CEO of a stealth early stage addiction care company. Um my primary area of research is the intersection between the gut brain axis and addiction across various substances including um foods, drugs and behavioral addictions. I was formerly the vice president and general manager of a precision fermentation company in the alt protein space and prior to that I was the chief operating officer of a fiber technology company focused on prebiotic fibers for gut health. My background is in chemical and biological engineering as well as business. And then Ivan, I'll pass it to you. Thanks. Um so my name is Ivan Kla. um half German, half Taiwanese, but actually coming to you from Portugal today. So, uh bit of an international background there. Been working in health for 20 years now. Um and currently I'm a health manager helping people to essentially manage their health and be well um through lifestyle medicine. And then I'd hand it back to you, Matt. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Yeah. So, we've got a great group of people here and I think you know the the way I'd like to start this first probably and unfortunately for you Ivon but we're here in the US and like Maha is just all over the place right and I think that's probably a good um place to to start. So, a couple of weeks ago, um you know, there was this news about, hey, we're going to get rid of these food dyes, you know, um all of these artificial synthetic food dyes because that's the thing that's causing the downfall for all of us, right? Um and then, uh some other stuff happened as usually does. And and just a couple of days ago, then we had this other thing, not directly food related, but it was like, no, no, Tylenol is bad for a pregnant woman. Don't take this at all, right? because it might lead to autism and things like that. So, um I'm not picking on any of those in particular, but the for first sort of like general topic here is like how much science and education is necessary to help us understand these topics today. Uh and maybe you know, Ivon, you can kind of start us off there since you're trying to help people figure figure this out. That's a good question, Matt. And uh um as a trained scientist both natural scientist and social scientist I would always uh root for science and say you absolutely need to have a scientific base. Um on which to make decisions. Um that doesn't necessarily mean that every individual has to understand every single scientific paper that's out there. Obviously that's uh not the not the kind of benchmark that we're setting. Um but in my personal opinion in terms of recommendations either for individuals or for the public so personal health or public health if it's not rooted in scientific evidence then quite frankly what are we doing like um that's just uh playing with people's lives really um because at the end of the day health uh impacts lives and to not use the methodologies that we have and the evidence that we collectively um as a scientific community have created is Yeah. It's just not very responsible in my opinion. No, I I hear that. But I I feel like and and I'm pulling this cuz like it's just come across my feed in recent days, right? Where people um what's the word? Uh how can I say this diplomatically? like oh that's your opinion or interpretation of certain things right um and one thing that you know as all of us are are scientists here are thinking and probably when we're reading things like I know there's this bit of fear about being wrong and wrong being that hey in science as you get more data right what you're going to think and and and recommend next sort of changes right and it kind of needs to update and evolve um and I know, like in most parts of our everyday lives, we're all very comfortable with that fact. But when it comes to something like experts out there telling us what we should eat or do or or all of those sort of things, there seems to be less tolerance for that, hey, it needs to be updated kind of thing, right? Um, and that's sort of leading into our topics of, you know, behavior change around all of this. But I kind of want to throw that out there to anybody to to kind of comment on that. But like why why does it feel like, you know, there's there's less wiggle room for scientists to say these things? Uh even though we know like basically that's how the world works, right? More data, things need to be updated. Yeah, I I wouldn't mind um jumping in. Um, you know, I I think some of this can be traced to a romanticizing of nature, you know, and and this interest in like natural claims, you know, on a lot of the products that I'm reviewing for clients. um you know for since since I started about 20 years ago um those natural that natural messaging is so appealing to consumers and over time that's evolved into this like clean label concept um you know which food companies sort of contort themselves to to fit in sometimes you know um and and at the It's sort of got gotten more and more extreme where, you know, now we're to the point where if a consumer um finds it difficult to pronounce a word like phospholipid, that is now equivalent to there being um a basis for having safety concerns about a substance. And I I find that level of um sort of mistrust of science or like a fear of chemistry or some you know chemophobia um I you know is something that's I think very real in California in particular and um that that's all very unfortunate because people are I think putting a lot of um they're having a lot of stress about issues that aren't like real at the end of the day. you know, I have two kids, um, a 15-year-old and a 13-year-old, and, uh, the 13-year-old, you know, has come home from school telling me that, uh, because she had like M&M's or something, uh, at Halloween, you know, that that kids are saying like, \"Oh, that has red 40 in it and you're going to get cancer, you So, so these are messages that are very um prevalent and that affect, you know, even really young children, like it's not just grown-ups. And um I think that's uh concerning because red 40, for example, is not associated with with cancer risk. Mhm. You said the word phospholipid, which means you have my complete attention since one of my fats and lipids and emotions. But I agree with you in that I think we're facing this time in our culture where there's so much more data available than ever before. There's so much faster information and communication going back and forth to so many more people than ever before. You know, previously you had to wait for your publication, you know, your professional organization to put out, you know, articles that had been peer- reviewviewed. So if a new ingredient was developed, you might not like hear about it until a lot of work had been done on it and decisions had already been made. And so I think there was more inherent like need to trust the people who did have the information because not everybody did. And now we're moving to a model where this information is and and like wishes, hopes, fears, dreams are getting spread so quickly uh that we are losing the usual ways the previous ways we had authority and trust in authority. So what do we have now? Like do we have any trust in people who spend their whole days and their whole like years and decades and careers like up to their eyeballs our eyeballs in this you know this one field are does that make us more trustworthy like as a scientist? I hope it does. Um, but you know what is what is authenticity and what is trust now in this age of like an incredible amount of data and the speed of communication being so high and and the horse isn't going back in the barn like we live here now. Yeah. I'm going to I don't disagree with the several of the points that have been brought up, but I'm going to try to steal man a little bit of the Maha argument. Um, and I largely view maja as a really bad answer to a really good question. And that really good question is there is something wrong here. People have lost trust in the experts because the experts or many of them have gotten something egregiously wrong when it comes to our food system. Over the last 50 years, chronic diseases have exploded. diabetes has exploded, obesity, Alzheimer's, addictions. Um, it's not gaslighting to say that, you know, I'm from the South, right? And so I've witnessed a lot of this firsthand. And so, you know, to say that there is something wrong is not fundamentally incorrect. The very unfortunate thing, though, is I think that sentiment is largely getting hijacked for people's own, you know, commercial or pet interests, right? You see it with maybe red 40. You know, there are studies about it being problematic, but getting rid of red 40 is not going to fix all these chronic diseases. You certainly see it with people railing against the modern food system and then saying buy my supplement, right? Probably not the right um place in the right time. So I I do think that ultimately scientific inquiry on bioscientific inquiry will help us really understand some of these root causes but I don't know that it is appropriate to say that um everything was good 20 years ago and it's this you know um proliferation of misinformation that is suddenly confusing people and leading down a wrong path. There is something wrong here. Mhm. No, I like what you said there too because as you were talking about that, I was thinking about uh how everybody now is fascinated with measuring stuff, right? we have like 10 different wearables we can have and we're measuring all of this stuff and then like you and and Megan were saying well which of this data is relevant and what what what part of those things that we're measuring is actually correlated to or maybe going to help us understand better the things that we need to do right um maybe this is a Avon sort of question right as you\r\n",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:September we going towards October people have gone without salaries especially the county staff madam speaker counties are borrowed you know once you borrow from banks once you pay you pay with a lot of interest I think as a house madam speaker we need to have a a conversation around this arrangement because madam speaker that spiritual involution is being diluted every every other Okay, because madam speaker we need to have an expressing dispensation on the timely dispersement of funds to counties. Actually speak I think we that is the reason why most of the governors would even want to claim that uh that is a genesis of quite a number of pending bills that we are witnessing because you know by virtue of having no funds in doesn't stop the services yeah we have those recurrent expenses are being incred almost every day we have vehicles getting failed we have so many other miscellaneous accretes that are taking place and I'm very uh some of these activities are current under the arrangement of we are going to get money. So I think honorable speaker we madam speaker we must get very clear arrangements on how we are supposed to make this disarmment effective. I don't know for what reasons I think I could in one of my good friends talk of a to Morocco where we have efficient very timely dispersement of funds to relevant counties where you don't have even to engage the national government. I don't know what's the role what is the role of government in the whole exercise. No, we have those very independent institutions which are supposed now to make sure that counties get their money timely so they can run uh the services are intended to be run and we expect maybe honor madam speaker once these funds are dispersed to counties we expect that the governors to be intelligent enough we make sure that money is put into proper use so that that the very essence of pollution is being realized. So madam speaker I strongly support that uh we pass this uh schedule so that maybe our counties can enjoy. But of course madam speaker I I it's very sad for me for the last almost four 3 months now people are going without salaries people are servicing their rooms some servicing their school fees and it's very pathetic madam speaker that we have to experience this kind of situation year out year in I support you madame speaker uh senator Um, Madame Speaker, uh, from the word go, I want to declare that I support this the report on the standing committee on finance and budget. Madame speaker, counties are distinct governments. It is unfortunate that throughout uh the period of financial year we are here always lamenting about disbbursements and madame speaker to me it is like the counties are on the receiving end when it comes to disbbursement and yet the law is very clear madame speaker that there's a timeline that is stated by The 15th of each month, county governments which are distinct governments as enshrined in the law, the constitution of this country must receive their funds. Madame speaker, the reason that is always given is that these funds are not available. But something else that comes out very uh badly, Madame Speaker, is that at the end of the financial uh year, the county governments are given funds at a go and yet there's hardly time to spend these funds. Then somebody erroneously makes comments that county governments are supposed to be ready to use these funds. Madame speaker, even the procurement plans that the counties have are drawn with the knowledge that funds will be dis dispersed at their rightful times. Madame Speaker, having said that county governments are distinct, it is important to note that we need timely dispersement and not only timely but as the as the report says the disbment of these funds must be stable and be predictable. Madame Speaker, predictability ensures that these funds are planned for and some wise people say said and I believe them and I know I'm one of them that when you plan when you fail to plan then you're planning to fail. Madam Speaker, the counties have various services that must be offered to our people at the counties. Key amongst them is the services of health. Just this afternoon, I've uh been here as uh these outstanding members of the Senate discuss the issue of Kenyata National Hostel and it is because health is key to all of us. Madame Speaker, for the counties to provide the services that are devolved to them like health which is a basic to our people. It means funds must be dispersed to them in time. We do not want a situation where when a schedule is already drawn out and approved, Madame Speaker, then we are treated to cases of counties lining up at the controller of budget office or at treasury. Madame speaker, we have met the controller of budget several times as a senate. I remember the last time the controller budget was appear uh was making a presentation while we were at NASA in a retreat and the controller budget continuously denied the fact that county officers always line up in her office in the process of uh approvals for disbbursement. Madame Speaker, this is a truth that there's a lot of paperwork that has to be done and yet what baffles me, Madame Speaker, is that the controller of budgets office also has devolved officers at the counties. So one wonders why what kind of work this devolved officer of the controller of budget referred to as the county office of the controller of budget does with the county government throughout the month because all they should be looking at is to ensure that the documentation is done at the county and officers do not need to spend all the time at the controller. of budgets off uh at the office of the controller of budget uh going back and forth to the counties in the name of going back to get certain documentation and this is a reality. Uh, Madame Speaker, Madame Speaker, what I'm saying is that the countries must have a seamless process of getting funds that are due to them having been approved by the parliament. Madame Speaker, there are several uh services that we are expecting the counties to offer in time, efficiently, and effectively. I've mentioned health. Madam Speaker, we need to get our people need to get drugs in hosts. Madame Speaker, it pains me when I'm in the village and you have women carrying uh sick children or even women sick and even men, Madame Speaker, when they are sick and they go to hosts and then they miss drugs in the names that funds have not been dispersed to counties. Madam Speaker, it is important to note that sickness comes at any time. Our people cannot only wait to be sick when they are funds our funds have been dispersed. And so that is an aspect of planning that must be done well. Madame speaker, we want to see our people having water uh as provided by the county government as enshrined uh in the law. We want to have our people getting various services access roads being done uh as uh given um in the devolve functions and madame speaker even in agriculture I'm a farmer madam speaker although a small time but I'm looking forward to getting to big time and I see the way farming is also expensive we want our farmers getting services. We want our farmers getting the right seeds. We want our farmers getting the right extension services advice from the county government because agriculture uh is devolved. Uh, Madame Speaker. So, Madame Speaker, I support this report and we look forward to a time when the issue of funds not in counties will be a thing of the past. Madame Speaker, you often hear in the from our counties in the national news about workers that have not been paid uh for months. We also want to ask our countries uh our county governments that they must do uh good planning that they know already the number of employees they have. They know the required amounts that uh they will be paid in the course of the the years. And so this story of workers, people going without pay is not a good story, Madame Speaker, because these are people who have worked for their governments. These are people who have families, Madame Speaker. These are people who have a number of responsibilities that uh their families look up to them uh to uh perform. So Madame Speaker, I support this and I want to say that Treasury must adhere to the constitutional requirements as enshrined uh in the constitution as per disbbursement of monies to county and the treasury must also uh must also ensure that they do not keep monies up to the last minute when the financial year is ending because We do want money spent well and we do not want to have any reasons for the county governments to get into any improper ways of spending public funds. Madame Speaker, I support Senator Mariam. Uh thank you Madame Speaker for giving me this opportunity. Madame Speaker, I also rise my foot so that to add my voice to this motion of uh cash disbburment schedule uh which was passed by the finance committee. I was one of the members who passed the the schedule. Madame Speaker, Madame Speaker, my concern is uh let territory not take this uh disbbursement as a formal. This is a formality we normally do yearly. Let them not take that. It must be a binding documents that make the treasury to be on toss so that they can remit uh by 15 of every month the way the schedule uh read. Madame speaker, madame speaker in the schedule I realize the highest counties paid is one of them is Mandera County. Madame Speaker, if I take you through the the schedule, July, the Mandera account received 993 m that is million, August 971 million, September 1 billion, October 1 1 billion, November 1 billion, December 981 million, January uh 1 billion, February 1 billion March 9991 981 rather April is 1.1 billion May 1 billion June 981 million Madame speaker this show that we are almost the highest figure the total amount is 12.3 billion madam speaker Madame speaker I'm reading this Because madame speaker in our area there is uh nowadays there is lack of \r\n",

Um, so I'll start I think I'll start from my left. We have Mary Stella Simu who is the Africa senior legal advocacy officer at the International Press Institute. And next to her we have Mutoki Mumo who is the subsaran Africa representative for the committee to protect journalists. And next to me we have Nadin Camp who is a program coordinator at Afia Amani Grand Lux. And next to her on my far right we have Mild Dam who is a climate journalist at the standard group. Um so this is quite a mix of um legal and policy advocates, media freedom advocates, climate environmental journalists and also disinformation experts. So I'm really um excited about this conversation and uh I think um from the session description some of you might have seen that one of the key things we're talking about here is not just climate related disinformation but also the disinformation targeted at journalists that report on climate and the environment. So there's definitely um I think an opportunity to delve deeper into uh the state of climate environmental journalism within Africa. it is important, but also think about how we can address the disinformation relating to climate and also being targeted at the journalists that report um on climate and the environment. And on that note, I'd want to kick off the conversation uh by asking Mary [Music] [Music] Okay. And when I went to the the comment section, there were those who agreed with him. those who added yes you know when it comes to carbon credit those countries who purchase from you know less powerful countries those who are performing better and then still continue damaging the environment and then there are those who just say yes I agree and say no I agree with other things 100% correct and I really wish the media house had done more in the cap in terms of directing that conversation because we need environmental reporters you know directing that conversation because at the end of the day Environmental issues are a very complex issue. Even when you look at the lexicon when we talk about climate change, we talk about biodiversity laws, we talk about pollution, sometimes it becomes one of those things it's hard for the ordinary person to connect with. But really, we can see the tangible consequences of climate change. So for example, we talk about climate change and link it to weather patterns for countries that agriculture is their main income earner. You can see that produce and it's affecting farmers. If you talk about biodiversity loss and think about fish people who make their living from fishing, we have heard that catches have reduced. So you can link the term biodiversity loss uh to to fisheries. Um if you think about pollution, you can think about how there's an increase in respiratory challenges across many African countries which are not there before. And so you can link it with our health complications. And also when I think about this, I remember which a Kenyan journalist told recently that he was taking a drive with a Kenyan politician and the Kenyan politician had a device in his car which he uses to monitor the quality of the air and uh he said that when he's driving in Nairobi he has his windows up because the air quality Nairobi is terrible and we are featured in the top 10 countries globally apparently the worst air quality and he said he asked Round two. It makes me think about the importance of climate and environmental reporting and why we are here today because they are the ones who shape the narrative enough for the public to understand why issues climate change why issues environment actually have an impact on our lives. They have an impact on our livelihood and it's very important to actually have the policy in place to be able to drive change in a way that we are actually protecting our future. We think about our land and we think about how this impacts our future. We need We need a climate and environment reporter to be able to to you know break down this conversation and the discourse and the lexicon around this and the language into narrative that can guide public discourse that can guide public interventions because we see great work happening in communities as well as drive policy action. And so when we ask why it's important at the end of the day it's about our lives and it's about our life. I'm sure we'll discuss this even more but let me stop there. Thank you very much Mary Stella. This was just also for us to appreciate why this conversation is important and I liked how Mary Stella linked it to the importance of climate reporting for communities that are relying for example on agriculture and fisheries for their livelihood but also even you know related links to issues around health. And I also appreciated the example she gave, you know, because I think leaders also public leaders have a role to play in terms of influencing um the climate narrative. And to see, you know, some respected leaders that have quite a strong influence across the globe um actually claiming that some of these climate conversations are hoax and that they are fake news. It's fake news. That's actually quite quite concerning. Um but I want to hand over for highlighting also that link and the importance to journalism because here is a climate journalist and I liked how you highlighted how journalists can shape the narrative and can help communities to understand some of these climate environmental issues. So I just wanted to hear from you um Natilda uh from your perspective especially with regard to the aspect of disinformation itself um as a climate reporter how have you seen this information shape climate narratives or the impact of your work in Africa and also particularly also looking at the role of corporates and states. Thank you uh very much and uh just to give uh confidence in our shipping of narrative to Stella that we're going to do justice to climate is hawks narrative by the Trump president and I hope our our reporting will be more in depth and making sense of what that means to us as journalists and as a continent and well thanks uh back to your question climate disinformation is warped in in the narrative around climate in two ways that I can think of which I've encountered u as a person. The first one is promoting needs like for example Africa's emission is too small to matter or fossil fuel is equal to development. So these are narratives that are often pushed by fossil fuel loists that tend to discourage uh investment in renewables on the continent and also just to confuse the public. And then for the second one is how disinformation impacts us as journalists. That is it targets us directly. I'll share with you an experience whereby I've been personally discredited online for publishing investigative stories around the dredged rivers within the Nile basin and Kenya's caron markets where trolls uh framed me as anti-development. And reading through those trolls, I could easily see them echoing corporate talking points. Um, recently uh we are also seeing the states weaponizing disinformation, accusing journalists of foreign agendas. So we as reporters and generally journalists, we face both distortion of climate facts and also reputational attack that is designed to silence us. So the two tend to weaken public trust in credible reporting and then you find that the two just derail climate action and ultimately for us Fred press freedom. Thank you. Thank you very much Matilda for you know sharing your personal story in terms of how you target that after doing an investigative report. We have seen that actually as part of the monitoring and documentation of attacks that we do at IPI where we look at attacks against um reporters. And we do see some of those coordinated disinformation campaigns where you know there attempts to discredit journalists because of the investigative work that they do and especially with investigative reporting because there are lots of interests also that will be um being protected in in some of those um attempts you know corporate interest interest. Um, so thank you so much for for sharing that that story and I just want to jump quickly still on that conversation on disinformation because Nadine here um she leads a network that does a lot of work around combating disinformation and hate speech in the Great Lakes region. So I want to hear from you Nadine what um has what strategies have worked on the ground um to counter climate disinformation and protect journalists from targeted attacks will be contributing in French. So some of you might need um it's all right. I think is on standby to help us can help us to interpret. [Music] Um, influenc [Music] [Music] going to translate. Um so um the response to that question is twofold. One of the she's going to first um of uh their initiative uh one being um against combating uh disinformation. One being training uh journalists, training influencers and training also community members who actually have a big impact on this information. foreign [Music] local big fake news. So yes, these people, journalists, influencers, community members are the ones that are the most used to spread misinformation, to spread fake news. So in the end what they do is training fact in factchecking and also making sure that the training that they give are in local languages so that people can know how to moderate information in local languages which is not usually done by those mainstream uh medias WhatsApp Tik Tok So one thing they do is um not making sure they they identify which are the social media that have been used to spread fake news and then debunk that information in those same uh social media channels. [Music] [Music] particip. [Music] So, one thing they do is listening to local communities to make sure to identify what is the rumor that's the the most spread, what is the rumor that's most influential, that's actually having the most impact in the community and then they re\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nclinton global witlative\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:All right. So I feel selfish for being my most famous people and I'm grateful that they're here. I'm going to start with President Asani and a lot of you who live in New York know this but the largest number of Albanians and Kosvors in the world outside the native land are in New York. I have two Osmanis on my street and uh my life has been sort of connected to there since I was president and I'm very very proud of you and your people. You were so young when you were elected and you have managed to accelerate economic growth and I think excuse me increase your security but uh theme of this conference is what's next And you're a walking embodiment of good news. If you do the right thing, give people a chance to have their life and make the most of their life. Most people are good people and they will make the most of it. The covar certainly have. So tell us what's next. Thank you, Mr. president and and good afternoon everyone. It's so good to be back at CGI and and this incredible panel. Um that is not as an easy question for a politician because when we say something then we have to keep our promises. At least we're the kinds that keep their promises. However, um as you rightly pointed out, Mr. President, Kosovo is such an amazing success story, but it's not ours alone. It's yours too and it's the success story of so many allies and friends around the world as I oftenimes mention and I think it's worth mentioning nowadays what the world is facing so many horrible wars and conflicts and so many people are suffering losing their lives and so much destruction that the case of Kosovas shown and it's it's such a great embodiment of what freedom loving nations around the world can achieve when they don't turn a blind They don't turn a blind eye on a people oppressed that is simply trying to live their God's human rights to be free to live their freedom and to have their basic human rights respective and I grew up like everyone else in my generation all the kids of Kosovo initially in an apertike regime then escalated to a genocidal war because of the butcher of the Balkans at that time And to grow up as a child of war, um, of course is the most horrendous thing to anyone. However, when you experience something like that and for the people of Costa experience something like that, it has meant that after the war, after we became free, because of our liberation struggle and your support, Mr. president and the support of the American people and American leadership, we never ever take our freedom for granted. Never. So I believe the fundamental has been to not take our freedoms for granted. And today um over two a little over two decades after we became free and less than two decades after we became independent, Kosovo according to the latest reports is the number one safest country in Europe. number one. Thank you. We're uh number three in the world according to Gallup International Index, number one in Europe and third in the world in terms of safety and security and safety and security and focusing so much on that has also brought economic growth. uh it has brought FDI, it has brought opportunities within the country, it has brought interest, but at the same time it has positioned Kosovo as a reliable ally and partner to other countries in the world because now now we give back. Now we partner with countries with the United States and other countries in Europe and elsewhere and other continents to help those in need. Our soldiers search shouldertosh shoulder with US soldier soldiers in peacekeeping missions around the world. We try to help. We try to share our experience. Our survivors of sexual violence during the war are now traveling the world to support survivors in Ukraine, in Sudan, in other in the Middle East, in other countries. So we're trying to give back while at the same time being very much aware that again freedom even today 26 years after war should not be taken for granted because look at Ukraine for 400 years they had to undergo occupation after occupation and now they need to regain their freedom once again. So we want to make sure and that takes me to what's next. Our biggest bet is on our people. That has always been Kosovo's greatest strength. We have the youngest population in Europe, techsavvy, multilingual, brilliant. They have been taking Kosovo forward the country with highest IT competitiveness rate and that is what is driving our economy and I think that's going to continue to be the driving force beyond behind our economy. But the challenge, the challenge, Mr. President, as you know too well, is maintaining peace. Not just achieving it, maintaining it. We still have a threat in our northern border because Russia's craziness goes well beyond the territories around it and the countries around it. They constantly want to threat of different parts parts of Europe, including the Western Balkans. And this triangle of evil that I call with Russia, China and Iran trying to push forward their malign influence whether through uh military, through economy or through crazy ideology are trying to undo everything that we've achieved together. We need to make sure that the same way that we stopped them so far will continue to stop them uh from now on. So maintaining peace, maintaining peace is a precondition to our continuing success. When you have peace, there's a chance for you to thrive. There's a chance for you to succeed. Whether in economy, in education, in health, internationally, everywhere. When you don't have that, there's simply a lost chance for success for any country, every society elsewhere. And my final point, another reason why KO has been a success story, it's it's women. Women have been at the forefront at the forefront of our peaceful resistance initially, then our arms resistance, our arms struggle, and then ultimately in the peacemaking and the peacekeeping as well as the state building process where women are included and are part of the decision making table. Peace always comes faster and it lasts longer. And that has been, you know, I uh I'm highly prejudically involved with them, but it is true. I have two coar families on the street where Hillary and I live. And our county I think has the highest percentage of Albanians from Albania proper and from Ko stay in. So I'm always given the latest news. But the thing I want all of you to know is there's something wrong when people have to leave their homeland to have normal lives. And in our little town, 3,400 people, all the last four Russians that belong to Albanians, and we have a taco place, most of the employees are Mexicans. of Guatemala, but the owner is a coal baby. And here's the interesting thing. The manager, the woman who gives me a beer every time I walk in the store. And when I was in there after we just opened the two latest restaurants, the woman asked me if I've been to the restaurants. I forgot to run one down, but I haven't got up the hill yet. And she said, I'm Orthodox Christian said, \"Well, you know, this restaurant up the hill belongs to a Muslim and he is a wonderful man and you should go. Why do we all have to leave home and how can we make it safe at home? So I want to thank you. Um now Dr. Pedro and I have been friends for many years because we met when he was the health minister in Ethiopia and our foundation went there to set up an AIDS program and to help them to build out a health system that was quite good and out of but didn't have enough presence in a massive number of rural communities they had and I thought Then said that probably got him in trouble. I said I would be really I would have been proud if this president he had been the secretary of health and human services in America. Today he'd have worked on getting jobs and vaccines but this man has been through all the challenges globally plus he had family to cry with all the problems that had happened within Ethiopia. He's had to live through that. Keep running the World Health Organization and watch others try to take advant health. What can you still do? What do you need help doing? What can this group do to help? Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for reminding me the days when you supported me in challenge when I was um the impact of your intervention still is felt. So thank you. Um currently of course we're passing through a very difficult uh situation um difficult times some call it call it interesting times it positive um as some of you may know the US has withdraw from the and I was actually in Tanzania when I heard the news in Tanzania to fight the M outbreak. Marb is like um and I read the executive order and four reasons put there. um the four reasons for the withdrawal actually are four good reasons to stay in that for the US and I was surprised and still we haven't had any direct discussion otherwise if these are the reasons I think it's actually good reasons to stay but that action is loose loose for the US so globally the question you asked US is withdrawn makes the US unsafe and makes the world unsafe as well. It's all of course even after withdrawal the US asks us for information on outbreak on this surveillance we share. We don't even ask any question because at the end of the day we want the safety of the American people because that's our nothing else. uh but since then we're moving forward and I have already proposed to the member states a revised budget significantly lower which removes the US contribution completely and based on the new budget in Europe we have already designed a new structure we have completed prioritization and we shaped up the organization starting from the top leadership reducing the size of the senior leadership by have and the prioritization has already been completed and reached already at the front line. Um and we're as we speak giving notifications annually to our staff who are leaving which really pains me because as the whole world knows um these are the same staff that just staff who have been working during pandemic day and night under serious pressure. They don't deserve this visit. That's what uh because it it's not but of course we have done all the uh process by following three principles uh transparency, fairness and humanity and in a way that maintains the core mandate of the organization. But although the whole process is painful because sending out my colleagues is painful. On the other hand, we see opportunity in this crisis. We see opportunity to strengthen the organization. We see opportunity to focus the organization on Monday but learn to work for others and even learn even if we are less than what we used to be with less to do more. And it's possible and it's an opportunity as well to make the organization independent because we should avoid in the future similar shocks and the main reason or the main challenge or risk for her which we have analyzed in 2017 and 2018 and we have been working to address that. Dependency on traditional donors is the main cause and whenever the major donor withdraws a shock like this happens but not only that with big amount of money coming from you can compromise your independence as well. So for the future what we are trying to do is develop map that we have prepared using this as opportunity to make the organization shock proof to prevent talks like this in the future by broadening the donor base and we are doing that and also make it independent when the donor base is broadened. We can absorb shocks but at the same time can be independent and our member states when we proposed this this is before When this crisis happened in 2022, they approved an increase of membership by 50%. And that's actually helping us during this crisis to minimize the impact. If it wasn't for this finance, we would have laid off more than double of the staff we're laying off now. So the reform is working and we're looking at it as opportunity. So we're moving forward. So there is the pain but there's the opportunity and I I I am confident that we can make the organization better. But we are not really worried about who of course the one is there. It's less of a problem than the impact of the US funding cuts for other countries on on developing world especially you know the services which have been affected now HIV, TB, malaria um and other uh programs um even you know in those countries I think lives are in because of the funding cuts. Um so the solution we are now agreeing which I I hope the you know I I I'm I'm encouraged that the countries are taking it seriously is um countries should move into their lands um and mobilize domestic resources and see this as opportunity to uh that and we're helping them with mobilizing domestic resources for instance alcohol and tobacco taxes will be the immediate and for the long term also insurance systems because there are resources that can help with this and for me as an African of course not only Africa as a developing countries but as an African I think Africa doesn't need charity it's fair terms solidarity and cooperation and I I'm not I'm glad I'm glad to see that in many meetings even during this anger many leaders saying um the same thing and taking the steps uh to move uh forward. So both for and for the countries affected. I think this is impacting and we're really losing lives. But let's see as an opportunity and let's have a strategic solution that can prevent future similar challenges from happening. Thank you. By the way, there's one thing I want to stress. Sorry again. There is one thing I want to stress. US and any government have the right to use its money the way it wants. The only thing from that we asked at the time was the US would have given some exit strategy instead of sudden cut 6 months or one year that would have addressed the problems we're facing now and could have saved the lives that we had we had lost. So the country has every right to use its mind the way it wants but it should not have been silent and there should have been a kind of transition but for me I think the answer is self self reliance and we can do resources and those donors who can support can focus on building so that countries should not get fish but should learn how to fish from the donors Thank you so much. I first met Chef Jose Andre more than 25 years ago when I was still president back in the dark ages. I just had a little poly. He was living in Washington DC and he came to help do a community feeding around. And Hillary and I went out to the site and serve food. And I'm not this guy ever was an immigrant in Spain. And I was totally blown away. I mean, most people who came to America trying to make their way didn't think about what they could do. and show the road to help other people who needed help. He did and I watched him for years and after I got out of the White House, we started working together all over the world just by accident because of the work I did in places where he was active. And I have been amazed to see the speed with which he has built a system that can serve huge numbers of people in distressed areas. And when I was worried about the CO epidemic, World Triple Kitchen put a food distribution operation in a parking lot at my library in Arkansas because we had a lot of low income people and he trusted us to deliver the food beyond the size of people who couldn't get there. And so we wound up between the two of us probably serving almost a million in just that one spot. And I watched this guy pull rabbit over and over and over again. God knows we need a lot of rabbits pulled out of our house today. So now what are we going to do friends? How are we going to keep going? How can we do more? How can we meet the needs? How do keep going? I think you know we're living in a moment that the clock is at zero. So let's see if they do this that at times you feel like you don't want to wake up in the morning because when you see all the great things is great when you see all the things are not so great I don't know if you have that feeling that brings you down a little bit and now is not the time to let the situation anywhere in the world bring us down. If anything, this is what it means to motivate us to be all next to each other to say there is not going to be a problem we cannot solve if we work together with books and how you said I saw you do when you were visiting this central kitchen 25 years ago when we met with action. U Kitchen is not a fighting hunger organization. is a emergency food relationship and we specialize in showing up quick and fast and solving the food issues immediately. I just came back from visiting my team in Gaza. We we already committed 100 million uh dollars. This going to help us do 1 million meals a day. um 1 million meals a day over the next year. We have um 60 community kitchen. We have two more kitchen um major kitchens. Next week, we're opening two more. This week, today we reach 427,000 meals. By the end of next month, we will be able to be reaching at very least 600,000. And before the end of the year, we are reaching 1 million meals. This is what makes The people the people of Gaza are in our opinion. They want our respect. Western doesn't feed anybody. Is the thousands of Palestinians working with us, feeding Palestinians. That's the way to do it. But at the same time, good for me. In the first day, we were in Israel. Why? Because it was the right thing to do. Because the people of Israel needed our aid. The next day we were in Gaza. Why? Because the people of Gaza needed our aid. What is good for you must be good for me. When they ask me, why are you in Israel? Are you pro-Israeli? Say yes. Why are you in Gaza? Are you pro Palestinian? I say yes. The only way we're going to be solving the problem is if we are Thank you. We we we partner with UN feed a lot of hospitals. Uh we are with a doctor called Dr. Hassan the new hero is 6 6,500 orphans. Um we are finishing next week the first uh home and a school for 1,600 and in the next 60 days we'll have the orphanage three orphanage for 6,500 children finished. This is not just giving a speech. We will do it. We are already building it and giving home to those orphans in the middle of the world inside Gasa. This is what keeps people motivated. You believe in the promise of very we are in Ukraine. Uh we are still in Ukraine. We were in Ukraine day one. We were in BHA day one. We were in person day one. We are now in the front lines mainly especially elderly. They are too elderly to move. So we make sure we are delivering around 300,000 meals a day to people that they are too old to go anywhere anymore. So we are there making sure that we support all the people that um we are um at the same time we've been supporting things like school kitchen. The first lady of Ukraine needed help filling with the schools. So uh it's been many people helping but we support a big major kitchen in Charih in the north and a big kitchen in the south in person. And with those two major kitchens we are able to be fitting multiple schools in a very big area and is the most safe way to be doing it. This is the way we keep doing it Mr. President. But the thing I'm the happiest Haiti I fall in love with Haiti will find it in Haiti. I feel I let down Haiti in the way that it's so much more we can all do around Haiti. This kind of beautiful place, beautiful people. So, we've been putting a lot of emphasis in making sure that in this situation in Haiti things go better. The best way to take care of the future of our country is taking care of the children. So, we we we we've been establishing already over the last year. We are right now in 700 schools feeding children with 700 kitchens but making sure that all the food is bought from farmers around every one of the school in the process of children we strengthen the local is no  we are doing it anybody can go and watch what we doing with local partners that know um what they are doing and you said when I say we committed 100 million here in C I just heard a met from Sudan move to LA. My daughter President was in chat and Sudan my young daughter working with Wford program and my daughter has been telling me daddy we have to go to Sudan we need to help Sudan we have to be in Sudan and I'm and just listening to Hanim here and that's why it's so important here in CI. I'm going to be committing with the fund I have under tables $1 million to the initiative of But this is what you've been doing for all of us. Uh, Mr. President, uh, call to action. It's okay we clap. But if you leave now and you do nothing until next year and you come here and clap again, please don't make things happen. And if you don't know what, look around you. You will have somebody next to you that will show you the way. I don't do anything. I only find people that show me the way. They I'm not empowering them. They are the ones empowering me. That's all. in many places and I have seen and set up these operations and then I've watched politicians screw it up very important. We fed a lot of people in Haiti, but they didn't take advantage of it. And we had a great feeding station on the border of Venezuela and Colombia, which is wildly successful. But there's still problems there. And that's I want to shift back now to our other panels. there. The world has always changed. In the 20 years since we've been doing CGI, it's a very different world on almost every continent. And there are places that are better off, but there are a lot of places that are more so. So, I want to start with you, Madame President. A lot of people thought I was nuts when I got involved in coastal and I told them I said you watch this would be the only place in the modern world where a war has ever been won through our air power because the cultivars will never and eventually will become too expensive for the serves to continue to fight and we'll save more lives. So, you've already succeeded beyond a lot of people's wildest dreams, but you were the first born president. You're the youngest president. How are we going to You look ahead. You look at all the things. Look at what's happening in World Health for example. What have you done and what do you think other countries should do to make sure that those who are on the right path stay there and get the support they need? Because I know you think about this. We do. We do every day. And I would say um the the easiest thing is to try to teach others how to do things. But uh it's uh probably not my place to do that rather than be a hand of support to those who need us right now. And there are plenty of countries that are going through what we have to go through. And um you know listening to what you had to say earlier, it reminded me of you know millions of people around the world who came to our rescue in our time of need. And you know today I might be speaking as president but you know years ago I was that child waiting in the line for food and that child waiting in the line for the support uh from the WH. So the children that you're helping today the women that you're helping today will be sitting here tomorrow. Um so my first My first point would be let's not stop let's not stop the help let's not stop the support for those most in need until the moment when they can get to live in peace and you said it rightly that most of ours would never bend we would never bend because you know we were a nation uh that endured occupation for initially for 500 years and then for another 100 and something years. And not any kind of occupation, not the kind of occupation that simply tries to push forward their language. The kind kind of occupation that tries to extinguish you and tries to just destroy you as a nation and deny your existence. that despite of hundreds of years of occupation, we never lost our identity. We never stopped fighting for our right to exist. And the example of the United States of America and other countries around the world standing by Kosovo has turned into such a success story because today Kosovo is such a strong democracy. It's such a resilient nation. as they said, a strong economy and a country that can deal with challenges. Of course, we have the support of friends because no nation can make it alone, no matter how big or small, but also a testament that smaller nations too can have an impact because we should not be defined by by our geography alone, but our impact should be defined by the story that we have to tell. So we continue to share this with the rest of the world without trying to patronize them because everyone has their own story and that is different obviously from ours. But we try to help them in becoming a resilient democracy. No matter how imperfect the system of democracies is, becoming a resilient democracy can help you then deal with the rest of the challenges so that we don't go back. There will always be forces that will try to set us back. God knows we have them in our own region. But when you're you have very strong foundations, foundations built on freedom, rule of law, democracy, and human rights that will help you deal with the challenges. And that's what what we try to share with the rest of the world. Because even in becoming a strong economy, our rule of law, democracy, and human rights efforts come out of this. Even when gaining support from the rest of the world, the rule of law, democracy and human rights have helped us. They have to go hand in hand. Even when we strive to become members of the European Union, our message is that you know EU values should go hand in hand with the EU cash, with the EU economic support. If you don't meet those values, if you don't fight for those values, you shouldn't get the economic support the EU provides. But that is the model that we try to share as I said without trying to patronize anyone because different countries, different regions, different continents face different challenges. But what we've learned is that when you never take your freedom, your freedoms in general for granted. When you focus on rule of law, democracy and human rights, economic empowerment and prosperity comes. And third, your strength ultimately lies in your partnerships. You need partners, you need allies, you need friends. And what you stand for and who you stand for in the most difficult times matters a lot. Uh and at the same time, give back. You know, you have to give back. One day Ukraine will regain its freedom, its total supranity. and it will be strong again. It's so important that they give back and support other nations that will be facing uh such similar similar divisions the same way that Kosovo today is supporting Ukraine. Kosovo is supporting nations around the world that are facing the same. And I mean I wish I didn't have to speak after you because I thought that should have been the conclusion. I I can't stress enough how important it is to say you don't have to be in politics to make a huge change in the world. You don't have to have an important position to do great things like what we've heard. Feeding a child that is in need changes more than just one life. It changes societies. It changes the world in its entirety. uh so much more than all of the speeches together that we had hold. So, thank you for what you do. I can't explain how much it means to those children because I've been one of them. I've been so over the spring is going to slow I don't want to end the Because if you think about it, his story at the end will be either the happiest or the saddest of all because he became the first African to lead the World Health Organization. men of unquestioned medical confidence and honor and honesty only to find not only world under assault but his native land divided by fresh conflict over divisions that affected his own family. I called him one day just to see how his family was getting on in Ethiopia and he didn't know. He couldn't get the news. And think how you feel if you weren't there. You couldn't find out about your family. You've given your whole life to this cause and then as soon as it seemed to calm down a little an existential threat to the World Health Organization emerged in the form of people. He's had to do that. So, how have you kept going and how do you think they will get other young people from Africa, young men and women to be trained as health workers and go into this war? Yeah. Thank you. Of course, the war in Ethiopia say it well. I myself and myself a war child. Um I was in Yemen last year, last December, December 26. And I was there leading a UN mission to negotiate with the to release our UN colleagues who have been detained by them. And while I was leaving SHA, the SHA was under attack by Israeli drones. So I survived narrowly. It was close. Two people in the town were killed and aviation colleague was wounded was close. Um and at that time what came to mind was not what was happening then the attack or the sound I heard that very end everybody was disturbed and we were running for our lives. But what came to mind is my memories from childhood. The smell the image even the sun. This is what we call. But that made me feel not just for myself, but I was in Jenna and our colleagues pass through this every single day. But I experienced it just for a few minutes and still takes me back in a memory lane. And then if you take Gaza, he was saying it I can't imagine how the cousins could live in that situation with Miss Bombardment every day. Um, and in my country as well, I'm a war child and when my kids were growing up, there was war and now there is war and I lost even closest families including my uncle. Um probably that situation not only understanding I mean the impact on me but understanding what's happening to the rest like the Gaza or in the you know those who under conflict that helps me to understand in the right perspective and probably encourage me to do more as an individual Yeah. So it's not about me but about what's happening for others and which is even more serious than what's happening to me. But there was even recently um in 2020 that's when the US withdrawal the first round came and there was war in my country and there was covid at the height of co it was a difficult situation um but if there is one thing that I try to um see then is of course this is the situation it's beyond my control but how can I understand the situation and focus on what I can do and that keeps me going I think that's the question but more importantly I think Jose has done probably more if you have a mentality of humanity first and that can give you some balance Fox are trickling out. That means we need to end this. Let's give a small hand. Please welcome Welcome to the stage David Fagenbomb. Growing up, I was always interested in health and medicine, but it wasn't until I lost my mom to brain cancer during college and I made it my life's mission. In our final conversation, I promised her that I'd dedicate my life to finding treatments for other patients facing deadly conditions. But a few years later, during back to school weekend, I found myself in the ICU dying from a disease with no treatments. I nearly died five times over the next three and a half years.\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ncultwj сна\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:25 and tourism. So today is Thursday until the 25th of September 2025. So to me first press briefing will be addressed by ambassador or Liberal representative to the mo and Julius Kobar Liber of President. So they're just showing how this welcome TV lab is taking us don't you go away to bring you full coverage of my cat regular rest briefing keep following police our guest Facebook followers, radio listeners, we like to welcome you to the CH William press hall where our regular Tuesdays and Thursday press briefings are held this afternoon. The presiding officer for today's press briefing is Liberus Deputy Information Minister for Press and Public Affairs, Honorable Daniel Sando. Minister Sando is here along with the acting minister of information, cultural affairs and tourism honorable Johnny Tap. Today press briefing will play host to Liberia's feminine representative to the international maritime organization based in London, Ambassador Ra Mosio Pal. Ambassador Pal will provide you update on the summit that is expected to be held in Liberia. The president of the president of Liberia, Mr. Dr. Judas Kaba will also come and talk about the president Labua anniversary. Without much ado, I'd like to invite Labua Deputy Spok Honorable Daniel Sando who will speak to you on progress made by the government both local and internationally. Good afternoon all of you. Good afternoon to your various audiences. We are happy to be back here behind this microphone in the historic Charles Buon Hall. And I want to say thanks to all of you for taking seriously the job, the piece of assignment that you have to execute at the ministry. Many of you come on time making sure that your gadgets are in place to provide courage for the government press conference. We also want to say thanks to radio stations that are relaying answer your questions provide you updates on a regular basis. So today we have and like family said we have two distinguished gentlemen in our m one does not need any introduction he is the president of the press union of Liberia Mr. Julius Kona we like to welcome you Mr. econom is here to just come in P anniversary. So he's he ain't come to talk government business yet come to use his platform because you know the ministry of information is a sector ministry for all library journalists. The ministry of information is the sector ministry for all Liberian journalists. And so when the president of the president of Liberia made a request and say okay we want to come to pass an announcement for the upcoming anniversary of the P can't say no to that. So what we'll do we'll kind of deviate from our regular protocol here the president announcement I'm not too sure you have question for him but if you have question he will take one or two and then he will leave us so we can talk about government matter also here is uh the honorable Robert Mal somebody who used to work here before but now in different capacity Liberia's permanent representative to the international maritime organizations and when you hear about all of the the transformation that Liberia can now boast of in the maritime sector talking about reelection back to category A the upcoming AMA conference Mr. Ra Pal is the progenitor of all of these reform. So he's here to talk about it and uh we want to welcome Honorable Pallet and his team to the refurbished conference room. Yeah. So as I indicated, I will now take my seat while I invite to the podium the president of the president of Liberia. We see what he has to say. He will leave and then I will come to do some housekeeping and then honorable pal will make his presentation and we jointly entertain questions from members of the press that are here. Mr. President, thank you very much uh Minister Sando for uh your kind words and for uh the introduction. So I would like to stand on existing protocol but also to state that uh the permanent rep um to the IMO uh he's a member of the fraternity. So um Mr. P yeah we extend our greetings uh to colleagues uh in the media from different media organizations. We like to say uh warm greetings to all of you. Uh it's good to be at the ministry of information, cultural affairs and tourism. Uh I know you're in your political season. I'm told uh tomorrow uh you'll be conducting a process here if all goes well, right? Uh so we are wishing you the best in terms of your decision making um to electing the new leadership. So it's good um to be here to be given this opportunity uh to speak um with you and to you. Uh I also like to thank uh minister fam acting minister I hope he becomes minister proper yeah for yeah affording us this opportunity uh we've been in talks a lot uh so colleagues of the media uh we wish to again restate the position of the union uh in terms of the anniversary celebrations. So on yesterday we officially announced that celebrations of the union's 61st anniversary will take place on Tuesday September 30 2025 that's next week. The celebrations will be held in Morovville and the theme of the celebration is commemorating our past constructing our future. We are happy to announce that the resident representative of the office of the Equas Commission in Liberia, Ambassador Joseph will serve as the keynote speaker. This year's anniversary is intended not only to honor the legacy of the PU in advancing press freedom and journalist rights but crucially to underscore the union's resource mobilization initiative for the construction of a national headquarters and that national headquarters will be known as the Staton Peab body media house. as I was coming in here uh the permanent rep said he's willing to make his contribution uh so we are happy that different people in society are contributing towards the construction of the P headquarters so the program on Tuesday will begin with a parade uh at 10 a.m. From the Capitol Hill campus of the University of Liberia to the P new hair office at Wan Avenue N Street in Sinko. It will be followed by indoor ceremonies starting at 12 p.m. So, three colors of t-shirts uh and caps have been approved and put on sales. I hope some of you already have your t-shirts. If not, you have to go because demand is high and supply may be limited on the eve or during the celebrations. Uh so the three t-shirts are in different colors like I said red, white and blue. So those color collectively symbolize uh or symbolizes those colors collectively uh symbolizes the continuing resistance against anti-free speech press practices through calmness relevant resource mobilization committee encourages all journalists and members of the P media practitioners across Liberia, inclusive of media workers and communication practitioners to join the celebrations and we need to take very seriously the solemn generation of journalists project to construct our headquarters that is the future permanent home of the press union of Liberia. So just a small background, the PUL as many of us know was founded in Monrovia on 30th September 1964. It was formed to advocate for press freedom and the protection of journalists. The breath of the P was a long struggle. It grew out of a crisis with the legislature. Journalist Taton Piboli as we said had written an article critical of the lawmakers. He said to refer to the lawmakers as radicals. So he was held in contempt, arrested and due. So he colleagues immediately mobilize solidarity action in support of Staton. So going forward the P has been existing for those number of years. So we are happy to live on that legacy. So colleagues in the media, we hope to see all of us at the anniversary celebrations. Again, we like to say thanks uh to the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism and all of our dignitaries uh who we've invited. They've confirmed their participation. So we look forward to seeing you. As the minister said, maybe if you have any questions, you have to come to the office, right? So, I'll leave you. Thank you, minister. Thank you, Minister. Thanks, police. So just just before we as the PR president honorable Julius Cannaba announcement and I I'm sure that the ministry of information will be fully represented. So we are wrapping up analysis on the president's presentation at the UN General Assembly and I then begin some rounds on the radio station. Many thanks to the publishers that have made it a duty to highlight portion of the speech delivered by the president at the 80th section of the United Nation General Assembly. The president's speech was a collection of critical concerns from the perspective of Liberia. He was well presented. He started by welcoming the election of Liberia as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2026 2027 term. The president indicated that this tenure to the council mark a significant step for Liberia's progress. 80 years after Liberia signed the charter of the United Nation, the president went on to reassured the world that although the office will be occupied by Liberians but the seat belong to Africa. He noted that Liberia will contribute to discussions and decisions that will shift our highend experiences in conflict resolution as well as our successes in peace building and democratic reform. The president threw light on wars in the Middle East, Europe, the displacement, climate change and indicated that these are challenges and no country can solve alone. He stressed the need for continuous effort to uphold multilateralism in transiting business at the United Nation. on the war in Europe in the Middle East. The president reminded the UN that peace is often fragile and must be consistently defended. He said forcing his support for all credible means for mediation efforts aimed at resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the Israeli and Palestine conflict. The president reinforced the common African position for a two-state solution in resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Liberia stands behind the common Afr\r\n",

I am not anybody. I am just a man of God, born again and saved. But a man who knows his God. And the Bible says those who know their God, they shall be strong and they shall do exploit. And so I was waiting to do that. But anyway, it was so mesmerizing and so humiliating because they're asking me for everything. I hope I gave somebody to to have a a little clip that I forgot a good one that somebody can I don't know whether media you have by clip I send you some I hope you have if you have it please organize and we show these people as I finish quickly and um so that I don't become a storyteller you know when you are young like me you have a lot of stories and experiences and explanations but I let me hope I'm going to inspire you by what I'm saying okay that looks like uh yes um now that's the the the community um and of course we have even gone to another community in Uganda called Karamoa who are primit uh who are marginalized and we are doing the same let's have a clip can make it louder in farms schools adult literacy renewal and women's empowerment to uplift entire communities. Anchored in John 10:10, this brings light to the darkest corners of Africa, enable the vulnerable and marginalized to experience true life in abundance. CIM's biblically empowered worldview is more than just a model. It is a movement worth replicating for community transformation across the globe. In our strategy we think about two things. One is modeling and the other is medicine. Modeling is where we believe that every success we have to come to a place where we identify the people with potential. Most times we find people working in our communities look at the people who are most but we look at the people because it is them who serve as models in those communities. Once we have people who have changed that we can see that we can identify with others. We had two three villages that we done and using those villages we grow them to 12 20 now there 80 villages most of the families are 1 2 3 or four five small D and they can now for two years it is very possible to reg it is very possible so when we bring people to RA and they see the work that is going on with people who had been previously relying on food aid, they become so inspired. If you can do it in a place like this that has only maybe three weeks of rain in a year, I know that I can do this back at home in Tanzania on my small farm. If it could be done in the driest plateaus of Kenya, it can be done in other regions, especially in Africa. coming down. I know I'm down. Thank you. Now that's not Yata. That's about Pot and Karamoja in Uganda where now going to POT. Now that's the area the dry area. Now we are having over 20 mission stations with the churches, schools and training center. Last week I was there with the governor of the area. Now because of Christian presence the government has made a road passing through their place. When I went 100 kilometers 200 kilometers I took two days. Now I take two hours because marginalization is a devil element. I went to the government to the national government to the county government to the governor and the roads are made. They have helped me to make dams for ev for most of the people. Now they are build schools or they helping me also to build schools. And when I'm going there is like a president from a certain universe is coming because I am not normal. Aha. You are not normal. You are not normal. You can do greater things. And that's what I want you to do. Not to sing choruses all the time and jump around. Yes. Singing I will sing. Dancing I would dance. But what you do after dancing you must do something. We can change this society. Last time when I was here somebody called me a day like today and said me you want the government wants to honor you as a national hero. I said, \"Okay, give them the details.\" They were given. When I went, I was honored. When I was just coming from my uh from the room, they said, \"There's another one that they want to honor you.\" I don't want the honor. I but I want to, but I not going to refuse them because I want the world to know I can beat them in their world. Are you hearing? We can develop competitive advantage over everyone. Why? Mhm. Why? Why should we have competitive advantage? I want you to listen to me now. Quickly, let's go back to Acts chapter 6 verse one. I'm not going to give you another example. Now, that's enough for you today. Now, in the book of um um of Acts chapter 6 verse 1, in those days uh the number of disciples was multiplied there. There was the mammarine. There was a social problem in Jerusalem. There was a social problem. And there therefore there was a need for solution. There was a need. There is a problem in Nigeria, in Africa, in Kenya, everywhere. And there is a need. There is a need for somebody to arise, for somebody to stand up and solve the problem. There is a vacancy. There is a fancy I want to say to all of you tonight and I'm speaking to you. I'm speaking to you. There's a fancy. There is a fancy choir somewhere. somebody to raise out of this congregation and go and sort out not even a spiritual mess a social mess. So there was a problem and um there was a need for social there was a social services vacancy. Seven fancies were needed and um and um because because the pastors the bishops on this side were very busy you know praying and uh preaching that's what they are saying. So there was a need for somebody from this side. Seven guys, seven people to come out and out of here as you listen to me. I am looking for seven guys, seven women, seven men. It doesn't matter today who stand up and identify a social problem, a political problem and go and sort out. That's why we are full of the Holy Ghost. I am full of the Holy Ghost. When I was when I because I'm full of the Holy Ghost. I went to Anaso Desert Ja and now it's a place everybody's going the world, you know, United Nation World Bank. Everybody's there. Everybody's asking me to be a consultant. But I'm too busy also doing the missionary work. But I don't refuse because I have a big team who go and work for me. So what I'm saying is um I am talking about you you you developing strategic uh competitive and advantage in this world. Competitive now strategic competitive and advantage in this world. And so the the business there was to ser the guys can Peter and John and others could go on preaching. And I want you to get number three verse three. Therefore, brethren, look out. Seven men honest. Underline underline the word hest. honest. Mhm. So the guys who are needed these are the qualification and the max after the interview you're going to pass the three if not four wholeness and of good report full of holy ghost like you. How many are full of the Holy Ghost? Wonderful. You might qualify and uh wisdom. Mhm. whom we may appoint over this business. So God is looking for man with three now qualities out of this congregation. I'm not teaching I am not teaching new theology. I don't do that. I am looking for you. I'm looking for you because I am not a good speaker. I am not at all. I can call you nonsense. I'm not very good. You remember I called you nonsense last time. Okay. I'm not a very good speaker. Yes.

Welcome to Ownership Conference 2025. I think we are on day three. Is it day three? All right. It feels like we've been here for a week. My goodness. It's such a condensed three days that we have had. So intense. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm just waiting for those who are still just walking around to please settle down. Settle down. Amen. I'm just I'm allergic to all these movements. Just settle down quickly. Amen. Settle down in Jesus name. I rebuke restless spirit. You know, stop walking around. Amen. Amen. Praise God. All right. Okay, quickly I just have a few assignments to do and um we'll get that out of the way because we really we have two powerful sessions today. One of my favorite, you know, gospel ministers in the world is in the house. I tell you, you know, I I I just admire him. Admire the way that God has used him to be a blessing to our generation. His songs at all times will bring tears in your eyes. And I remember one of the I think it was some concert you did in UK. I was like Kados I was listening to that song and I was weeping like a child. I was in Dubai airport. I will never forget in uh Dubai. Yeah. Emirates. And um when I got there, my flight was delayed. So I began to play. That was when you released Emperor of the Universe. I listened to that song more than 100 times with tears all over my eyes. And I said one day this guy is coming to House of and by the grace of God. Hallelujah. You know, you know the amazing thing. Let me let me tell on him. Can I tell on you? Yeah. Let let me tell on him. So, so I've called him. He we've spoken. Don, please come. Come to Macedonia. Come and help us. Come to South Africa. I will call Don. Hey, he is so busy. I called him. He said he was in Canada with Apostle Joshua. He was here. He was there all over the world. And you know, I then got tired. Somebody say, \"I got tired.\" Mhm. Then I'm in Kenya with Apostle Joshua Selman. We were together. We went to dedicate a building. We just left there. While we entered the car, I was driving behind my wife and I were in the car behind Apostle Joshua. My phone rings. Who is it? Dons. I said I told my wife I said this one Dunson is calling me. Dons says ah man of God the Lord wants me to be in your meeting. Haha. Ah, I my wife is there, baby. I just I said to my wife, I love Jesus. In fact, I was saying it to you on the phone. I say, I love Jesus. He went to speak for me. Men of God, you are welcome to South Africa once again. Oh my God. Your songs have been a blessing. We have stepped into dimensions with your songs. Our choir sings your songs literally almost every service. Amen somebody. Hallelujah. Please allow me to just welcome all the five-fold ministry gift. If you are a pastor, uh a prophet, evangelist, teacher, uh bishop, apostle, pope, you know, please can you all stand? Let's just welcome you. Please can we just celebrate them? Let's celebrate them. Let's celebrate all the servants of God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being with us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being with us. Amen. We truly truly appreciate you. Praise the Lord. Now, um I'm going to do the offering, but there's two parts to this offering. And um I spoke to you, I think it was 2 days ago. The Lord, you know, would have me do something that I've never ever done in any ownership conference. and um he said to me, \"I want you to receive an offering for the guest speakers.\" And that was very strange for me because um you know I'm not you know that kind of person but he said to me I should do it. So this morning I'm this evening I'm going to receive a special offering for all our ministers. Everyone who has been here to minister instead of when conference finish you start queuing up to drop offering. It's very embarrassing. Amen. Let's do it right here in church. Can I hear an amen? All right. Uh give me the book of uh third John or Yeah. Third John uh and uh verse 5. Third John and verse 5. Give it to me in the New Living Translation. Please pay attention everybody. Please settle down. Just sit still. Amen. Third John and verse 5. He says, \"Dear friends, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who passed through who came through South Africa to ownership conference.\" The Bible says even though they are strangers to you, Naz, he said they have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that does what to God? So that means that there is a kind of giving you give to people who God sent to you to minister to you that pleases him. Are we reading Bible? Uh-uh. You see when you talk about money your voice goes down. If I say receive now amen. Are you here? All right. It says next verse. For they are traveling for the Lord. Who are they traveling for? So when when Dunson left Nigeria to come here today, who did he travel for? The Lord. And he says, \"And they accept nothing from people who are not believers.\" So what God is saying is that he does not expect unbelievers to take care of them. He does not he does not expect unbelievers to look after them. Please put back stop showing me what is your challenge. He says, \"So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as they do what they teach the truth.\" This is the will of God. Somebody say amen to that. Now, do you believe the Bible? Do you believe that what I just read is the Bible? All right. First Timothy chapter 5 and verse 17, same New Living Translation. 1 Timothy chapter 5 verse1 17 the Lord woke me up in the middle of the night while I was preparing you know just pray praying for service two nights ago I told you guys he says elders who do their work well should be respected and what else you see unfortunately we are in a generation that you are a believer but you are listening to people on social media Listen to Bible. Listen to what God said. We we we are a people that believe in the word of God. The Bible said that elders who do their work well should be respected. And what else? Uh don't say it with jealousy or with anger. It's not my fault that God did not call you. They must be what? I want you to shout, \"Let the devil hear you.\" They must be what? Paid well. It says, \"Especially those who work hard at both what? Preaching and teaching.\" Next verse. For the scripture says, you must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain. And in another place, those who work deserve what? What do they deserve? You know, it's amazing how the society or our world think that pastors are not important. the work of ministry. We are just a people that sit down and enjoy ourself. Sometimes when I I I hear people say, you know, these pastors all they are doing is enjoying. My question is come and enjoy with me. Start a church. Let's see. I mean, if you think it's easy, just do it. Are you hearing me? Somebody do it. You know, but this is the scriptures. He says, next verse, next verse, he said, \"Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless is confirmed by two or three witnesses.\" Somebody say, \"Amen.\" Amen. Now, God has sent us these people. I believe there is a reason after 10 years of this conference for me to do this the first time. This is the first time. Some of you have been attending this conference. I've never done what I'm doing. It was an instruction given to me. I want every head to bowed. Give me envelopes. Give me envelopes. Every head bowed or eyes closed. Just give me envelopes. I want to call for a few people or those who say I want to sew. Please give me envelopes. Ash ushers. I want to call for some people here. And you say, \"Apostle, I'm willing to thank you. I have to do this. My guest speakers, I don't expect them to do this. So, I have to do it.\" Amen. And I'm not afraid of you. Amen. You must know that. Praise God. You know, the people in in the world or in darkness, they finance all their projects. That's the truth. They fund all that they do. And the gospel is to be funded by us as God's people, not unbelievers. I don't expect a Muslim to come in here and give me, well, I expect and if it happens, I won't say no. Amen. But nonetheless, the the according to God's order, it is us who are here that are supposed to do this. As your heads are bowed, I want you to just pray in the spirit for a minute or two. Lord, what would you want me to sow? What would you want me to give? Most times after our conference is so embarrassing for us to have Apostle Joshua just wait people are queuing up to give and now you are doing it here. You don't have to be you know we don't need all that drama. Every offering we are receiving now is going to go to our guest speakers. Can I hear an amen? Can I hear an amen? Now I know bloggers are going to take what I I'm saying, they will misrepresent it. That's their problem. I don't care about them. I care about the kingdom of God. Whatever they say about me, I have thick skin now. My skin is like elephant. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out. So, you know, I I don't care what they say. You are here today and you say, \"Apostle, I can do a,000 to $10,000 as an offering to our guest speakers.\" Just where you are, raise up your hand. You can do $1,000 to $1,000 is $17,000 rand is that much? 17,400 or 18 less 18,000. You can do that. Please can you step out and collect this envelope from me? Please step out. Step out.

And you have a reason for everything. There is nothing you do that is purposeless. And so Lord, these people that you have called out to give this sacrifice to honor the men and the women of God that have come here to be a blessing to us both in preaching and in ministry of songs. Lord, I ask that as their hands are lifted to heaven, may you that see all things and know all things, may you remember these people for what this offering is for. And I pray that every one of them that is standing here that the grace is upon this men and women will begin to find expression and manifestation in these lives. Lord, honor them. Honor them, Father. It's always been your method. You said to Moses, tell the children of Israel that they bring me an offering and that they build me a house that I may dwell among them. that your presence will answer to every challenge, problems, every issues that are in their life. Lord, I ask you Lord, please just help her. I ask you Lord that may the glory of God fill their lives and fill the work of their hands. Father, help them. I am asking you, Father, help them. Oh God, help them. Let no one who has given this sacrifice go unrewarded. Lord, as your servant, I have obeyed you and I ask you, oh God, to do your part in their lives in the name of Jesus. You will never have any reason to weep again. Your morning has come. You have entered your chairos moment in the name of Jesus. Thank you father in Jesus name. Now you are going to go to all the speed points. Go and swipe. If you don't have it in cash you can swipe. You can do transfer. Please put the banking details on the screen. I want you to put the when you give the seed put it there ownership uh ownership guest speaker seed. Okay. As your reference. so that our account department will be able to sort that out. Will you do that? May the Lord bless you. I love you. I love you all. Thank you for obeying God. Thank you for honoring God and honoring his word. God bless you. You may go back to your seat. I truly truly appreciate you. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. All right. Now if you have your tithes your offering let's give to our father remember we get seated when we give offering and then please can we do that in a hurry as you are doing that I will call up the men of god amen all right please settle down go back to your seats thank you where is uh troops where is fortunate or troops where are they Just hand this over to them. Hallelujah. All right. You have your tithes, your offerings. Please bring it out. Let's bless the Lord with our substance quickly. Heavenly Father, we are grateful. Thank you, Lord, for the offerings we are given today. Lord, I thank you, Lord, that if you needed anything, you would not ask any of us. But as a matter of principle in your word, the scripture says, \"He that sweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly. And he that sweth bountifully shall reap bountifully.\" He said, \"Let every man give as he has purposed in his heart, not of necessity nor grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver.\" And Lord, we pray that you make all grace abound towards us. that we all having all sufficiency in all things shall abound to every good work. Thank you heavenly father in Jesus' name we pray. And everybody say all right. You can also go and sw...",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ncompound insights\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:[Music] Welcome to Compound Insights, a podcast by CFA Society New York. I'm your host, Rob Rowan. Today we're talking about impact investing, particularly measuring its impact with precision. Arcelon Matafar leads JP Morgan's development finance institution. Its mission is to channel private capital to investments with a developmental impact. And I'm pretty sure from my research it was the first of all US banks to do this. Now Arcelon was right at the middle of this because he worked with the development banks to create uh JP Morgan's DFI methodology. Previously he worked with governments on through McKenzie's economic development practice where he advised countries on their growth strategies. Arcelon got his bachelor's from US UC Berkeley and his mers in international development from Harvard University. So Arcelon, welcome to the podcast. Thank you for having me Rob. So impact investing is challenging to say the least in many respects but you know developing an a methodology for determining impact is hard and can take a long time. So um how do you you and your team uh accomplish the measurement of impact? Well Rob I think impact investing as you mentioned is really hard but it's especially hard to do it in capital markets and wholesale banking. the most of the impact investing you probably see out there is done by private equity firms investing in social enterprises and they, you know, take a board seat. They're much more in touch uh and engage with the management of the company and therefore they're able to probe a bit more. They're able to collect data much more and they're able to kind of steer some of the decisions of the management in order to achieve more impact. But the problem with that is that it can't scale beyond a certain amount, right? private equity uh space is a limited asset class and you know there's billions of dollars that for instance in developing countries are invested through private equity but if you really want to uh address kind of the global challenges that we have you need to be able to mobilize money from the institutional investors that are active in public markets and so that's what we really set up to do with the JP Morgan DFI another thing I'll mention is that when you go into the public markets there was already an existing asset class named ESG as a I wouldn't maybe call it an asset class but at least as an approach to investing uh which is distinct from impact ESG was much more internal facing looking about how investor can reduce exposure to companies that present environmental social and governance risk with the uh way that they typically do their business versus um impact which is searching or companies that produce measurable social and economic and environmental good in society. So it's a much more output and outcome oriented thing. If you look at kind of the assets under management that were looking for impact in public markets, the easiest places they could find them were for climate. Climate impact is much more easy to identify. If you're investing in a renewable energy company, if you're investing in, you know, energy efficiency and, you know, electric vehicles, all of that, it's a little bit easier to kind of find the impact thesis there. And that's why we see a lot of sustainable and impact assets under management in public markets mainly going to developed countries where there are much more larger pipelines of such climate finance type of projects and much less in developing countries. So we thought if we were to measure not just impact but a specific flavor of impact called development impact defined as helping improve the quality of life of people in developing countries, reducing poverty, reducing inequality, providing access to basic human needs, we need to consult with the people who have been doing that for many many years and they happen to be outside of Wall Street and be in the official sector where official development institutions publicly owned you know organizations like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank have been using methodologies for decades on how to measure development impact and learn from them and create an approach to be able to apply it uh to capital markets um that uh are being channeled towards developing countries. Okay. Well, see you made it sound like a little bit less of a daunting task than it probably was. You made it sound really easy. You just go to the development banks and take what they did and then just build on top of the capital markets. That was a half a sentence. How long did this take you? So that took near near a yearong effort. Um because you're absolutely right Rob they are a different beast. I mean the development banks themselves are typically have you know one or two main products. They either lend or they provide um some direct equity investment. We in an investment bank have a long list of products. We uh advise on M&A. We underwrite debt and equity. Uh we syndicate loans. We you know do custody and fund services. We do, you know, derivatives that hedge risk from commodities to FX to interest rates. So there's so many more things that we as a investment bank do. And there's also a different life cycle to a capital markets transaction and a public deal than to you know the kind of private direct engagement uh that a development bank does. But I think we had one thing going for us as an investment bank is that, you know, we typically are the ones that are doing due diligence on an entity before uh we help them raise capital in the public markets. And we could use that capacity to do not only due diligence on the financials of the company as we normally do, but now do do due diligence on the development impact. um and essentially uh adapt and adopt the methodology in a way that uh in that capital markets life cycle can provide that information for the benefit of impact focused investors. And then the other task we do as a U investment bank is then to distribute those assets to institutional investors and essentially market that asset to a range of portfolio managers and uh that that are searching for assets that have both financial returns and positive impact. And there again it required a lot of I think socialization of our methodology to be accepted that a transaction that on the surface you know you know it's not climate finance it's not necessarily something that just has an environmental perspective which was an easy thing to check the check boxes of a uh sustainable or impact investor but then to show that if it's gone through a methodical uh diligence and has a development impact thesis it should also be eligible for a sustainable portfolio and that required many many additional years of time to socialize that with with the uh you know private institutional investor community to get that uh consensus and was there much in the way of well as JP Morgan is a GI and one of the more regulated organizations on the face of the earth not that I'm not talking about airlines or airports but pretty close right was that also a factor in how you built the methodology or was there already enough you you all have lots of methodologies. So, was there already enough work done on that that you could you could get it into there? I think the methodology part was a little bit more a a marriage of doing something that is both you know rigorous and technically correct but also uh practical uh within the time frame and within the situations in which we operate. That was for the methodology. But then when implementing the methodology, Rob, you're absolutely right. Being a highly regulated organization, anything that you're doing that is in any ways new in a bank requires layers of work that you need to do with different functions in risk, compliance, controls, legal, and to build an infrastructure that allows you to do something that is relatively novel for a financial institution. So we went through all that and created, you know, a lot of the rules of the roads and the compliance. And we also showed that that at the same time something that we're doing if you again kind of take the you know a few steps back and you look at it from a little bit further you know holistically um is not that different either from what is our role which is mobilizing capital from you know people that want to invest their savings to people who need it for you know growing their business. It's not that different from a role of, you know, an underwriter and doing the due diligence and presenting the investment opportunity. It's just an additional layer on top of that that adds the development impact assessment and broadens the outreach to impact focused investors. Okay. So, not to talk about all of Arcelon's headaches, but let's talk about one of the other headaches. You mentioned it earlier, scaling. Yes. So, how did you how has that evolved? How did y'all handle that? So first it was a lot of zoom meetings backtoback all day every day um with you know both sides of the equation I think you know as a capital markets intermediary uh you know on one hand our clients are those that want to raise capital these could be both companies as well as sovereigns um you know whether it's local governments or national governments to tell them you know what the process is what it entails in terms of effort and in terms of time and um what the benefits would be and the other side to the investors to share with them you know what the again the methodology and the process is and how that might satisfy certain impact and sustainability criteria they have. So that required a lot of socialization with those two client sets required a lot of internal socialization with our bankers because we are a relatively small team but we cover 80 countries. Right. Right. and most of the world and the way we do that is that you know JP Morgan has offices in you know 80 of the you know uh lower to middle inome countries and so we can cover all of our clients in those geographies through our bankers educating our bankers on when it would be appropriate to pull us into a deal how they can uh pitch our capabilities to their clients you know we can join some of those pitch meetings as well but you know through them. We could help uh socialize this with with a large client set as well as on the investor side with our sales organization which again covers all of the institutional investors across the globe. Here it's mainly in developed markets in the US, Canada, you know, all of the European countries, Nordic countries all the way out to Japan and Australia where there are also pools of capital that are seeking both financial and and and social returns. So those are the providers of capital and the users are in the low inome countries. But after that effort and after doing that for about three years, we launched in January in 2020 and then in April of 2023, we actually convened a industry working group comprised of 10 of the largest investment banks, you know, folks like Bank of America and HSBC and Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank and the Texas and Sockgen. those folks some of the largest institutional investors that invest especially in emerging markets and sustainable investing in emerging markets like Amundi and AXA and Goldman Sachs asset management and bearings and CDPQ. So we brought all these. So we brought some of the development banks again, Asian development bank, the French development agency, the US development agency. We brought in industry associations like uh IKMA as an observer, the uh international sustainability standards board, ISSB as an observer, UN agencies that focus on you know uh international development and we put our methodology again on the table and we said let's think about how can we make it better and how can we make sure that it addresses everyone's best thinking and ultimately everyone's criteria for sustainable investing in the margin markets in a way that we could again scale this up because no matter how much we do it as just JP Morgan and we're the largest bank in the world but we're still less than 10% of you know market share in securities underwriting and sales and so if we want to meet the challenge of global development and the trillions of dollars are needed in order to finance it. We need uh we need other you know people to engage with this uh space and and to in many ways replicate the approach that we had had been doing and uh and and just uh in a few weeks we will be publishing the final version of the guidance that is coming out of this working group that has been working for about a year and a half. So everyone point your web browsers over there. It'll be two weeks when you rough roughly two weeks when you hear this podcast. I guess one of the things that I'm curious about is I would I would guess that for all of those people that you brought together, one of their biggest sticking points is probably due diligence. It's complicated. Yeah. It's a lot of work. It's expensive and then you had a lot of places you don't have a lot of benchmarks, right? Is that fair or were there were there other sticking issues that they had? I think that's true, but I think the problem, you know, I mean, if I kind of double click into that is that there's not a standardized approach for how to do that due diligence. And when you don't have that, even if you do the diligence, but then someone says, \"Okay, that's interesting information, but it wasn't the information I was looking for. I was looking for this set of criteria and do you have any info on that?\" And they're like, \"No.\" And then you go to another investor and they have a different set of criteria. And so a lack of standardization in the industry is the best you know the biggest constraint to scale right and so when we brought this group together and we you know deliberately brought kind of equal representation from the sell side and the buy side was to say that let's agree on a common set of standards of how we measure development impact impact on the sustainable development goals in these kind of public markets so that the buy side agrees that yes if disclosure exists this in this format, following this methodology, following these kind of set of criteria, then yes, we agree that it will be eligible for our sustainable portfolios. And then in many ways the sell side has both the kind of guide book on how to do it but also an incentive now to go through that process and spend that additional time and money and effort that it is because they know that doing so would expand their reach to trade and sell to a broader pool of institutional investors. So that kind of uh collective action problem was in many ways addressed by by bringing these uh groups together. It's fascinating. So that's one of the major issues. Could you talk about from your perspective what the other trends in this let's call it a sub sector are? Yeah. Are the what are the other things that people should be thinking about from an overarching perspective? Yeah. I think from an overarching perspective, another uh thing that we've maybe done that I think maybe changes the paradigm of how the investment should be done is that a lot of people when they were looking for sustainable investing, they were looking for projects. They were looking for one infrastructure project here or one kind of education project there. It's always it was a project based approach to to investing. And I think that's fine. There's definitely projects that should be financed that can be ring fenced can be created as a you know special purpose vehicle and have no recourse to any other kind of balance sheet or sponsor and be self-contained in both the revenues and the financing and you know the ultimate how how the profits are distributed. But it's not enough and people talk about this all the time. there's a lack of projects because there's not enough projects that in emerging markets that have already been completely costed out. Feasibility studies are done, offtake agreements are done, you know, environmental, social studies are done. There's a lot of upstream work that needs to be done for those projects exist. That's one. And second is that even if they do exist, often the projects in developing countries are smaller than the ones in developed countries. And because of that subscale, they'll never have the ticket sizes that are needed for those large institutional investors that manage the trillions of dollars of assets under management. So it was just a fundamental constraint that was kind of clogging up the the pipes for for money to go to places where they're needed. We took that away by saying, well, you know where else there's a lot of opportunity? Just plain old corporate financing. financing the general balance sheet and budget of either governments or corporations that just want to do their business and grow and by growing serve the underserved in their communities. But how do we ensure that then that's different from just conventional financing and we said well okay what if we shift the lens of analyzing a project and you we take it and put it on the overall entity. So we say okay if an entity let's say a company let's say a cell phone company in Tanzania meets a certain standard of impact measurement and management and kind of ahead of time Xanti discloses plans for expanding in a way that is sustainable it's responsible it's inclusive it's meeting the needs of the underserved and ultimately addressing development gaps if they meet a certain threshold of doing so then their full balance sheet their entire corporate financing their mainstream banking should be eligible for sustainable finance. We thought that as a much more scalable solution than creating another labeled instrument and painting it I don't know orange and then saying okay now this is a new asset class for development provide financing to those that have committed to addressing the development challenges in their country through mainstream channels if they meet a certain uh standard of impact measurement and management. Okay. So it's a little bit like where ESG went from an investable product to more like a screen for all products. Right. Right. Okay. And this will now become a screen for all entities. Right. And once that entity is seen to be addressing and advancing the sustainable development goals, then that entity should be eligible for sustainable capital for their equity, for their debt, for their revolving credit facilities, for their trade finance facilities, for their corporate derivatives, for whatever they're doing that ultimately helps them finance their business. and grow whether it's going to OPEX or capex or to a ring fence project or whatever it's going as long as they meet a standard of transparency on their impact then it is sustainable and and should be eligible for civic capital. Again, different investors will have different criteria, and there's going to be some that say, \"No, no, I only want to sell invest projects.\" And that's fine. If that's their mandate, then that's what they should do. But we think this broadens the aperture to bring in more sustainable investment opportunities to market. And what's really interesting, Rob, is that in my conversations with investors, what I hear is that it's the lack of supply that is the constraint. It's not a lack of money. A lot of people think, \"Oh, there's a $4 trillion gap to financing the CGs. There's probably not enough money.\" No, the money actually says that, you know, I have more demand from people who, you know, pension funds and whatnot that want to give me money for sustainable investing in emerging markets than I have places to deploy that money. So, the problem is a lack of supply. We think that this approach will really increase the supply into the market. All right. So, can you at this point, I know this may be impossible, we'll take a crack at it. Can you forecast how much that might close that gap? Yes. So the first order effect we think and this is just by taking the volume of transactions that we at JP Morgan evaluate to have development impact and grossing that up by our market share. We think that this if this approach is adopted by the industry it will bring over $200 billion of additional supply of development impact investment opportunities to the capital markets each year. Oh okay. each year on an annual basis 200 billion and that's the first order effect. We think the second order effect is that if this increase in supply then allows the investors to grow existing funds right now the total amount of assets under management for sustainable investing is about $3.5 trillion and they're telling us it's a supply side constraint that we're not growing that number. So if this additional supply then motivates them to increase the assets under management for sustainable investing then there will be more incentive for the issuers to issue even more sustainable investment uh opportunities and so that could have a you know a virtuous cycle that can grow you from the you know couple hundred billion to you know orders of magnitude. Yeah. And just thinking about that in terms of size at 200 billion it might only be a couple years before you start to address in a meaningful way the scaling problem. Right. So exactly f that's fascinating. So are there other trends that you anticipate? Yes. So what we really see this Rob is is a bit of an ecosystem play right like we are bringing all of the different players into this space to kind of build this ecosystem scale things up. And this ecosystem is going to need some other components as well. for instance, it's going to need market infrastructure. So, currently all of this data on impact and everything, we've been putting it on a PDF on a page and emailing it to investors and whatnot. And you know, there's a limit to the scalability of that approach. So, we uh we're thinking about now building an impact data platform which will digitize this information which will make it much more easier for the investor side to filter and search through. there's an investor sitting in the Netherlands and says, \"I really want to invest in, you know, companies that are advancing food security in West Africa.\" They could just punch it now into this platform and see any companies that have meaningful metrics and targets and accountability and transparency to reporting progress on advancing food security in West Africa. And then they can, you know, go to their, you know, dealer, you know, investment bank and ask, \"Hey, do you have any securities from these type of companies?\" and uh and you know we can either originate and and and sell it to them or you know we might be already in the process of already doing so. So I think that market infrastructure is one trend. I think another one is third party a whole suite of thirdparty services. the end of the day, you know, I think a fundamental cornerstone of what impact requires is trust, right? Like you need to be like, \"Yeah, this is this is really having a positive impact.\" And you know, obviously transparency on the reporting of the person who's getting the money is important, but then you want typically independent verification. You want monitoring and evaluation. You want to know was it that company's specific activities that had a causal effect on those impacts on society that were generated or was it just luck or was it something else? So, you know, you need some more detailed analysis. You need to kind of poke the theory of change that is being claimed that the output of one company is going to lead to certain societal level outcomes. You might get academia involved to test those theories with a variety of research that they do. you're going to need benchmark indices to be created that are have you know impact as a criteria for inclusion in that index methodology so that the asset manager can have a relevant index to benchmark their portfolio against. So you know you're going to have a variety of analytics products and you know things like that. So the there there's a whole kind of suite of third party services that are going to need to be developed around development impact investing in capital markets that again through this effort we are already working on but we think that uh I mean we invite any one of your listeners to to really reach out to us and engage with us uh as we build this out because it's again a it'll take a village right and that's a business idea folks right there that's how CFA New York's podcast delivers you aren this has been fascinating. Thank you so much for the uh the insights. Um there's a lot more to learn here uh for most of the members I'm sure. So uh but you all have done a lot of work here. This is it's really interesting. So congratulations. Thank you so much Rob. Thank you for having me.

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ndws azerbaijan*s president aliyev highlights economic progress in un\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Ladies and gentlemen, for many years I spoke from this tribune about tragedies of aggression, occupation and injustice experienced by Azarbaja. Today I will speak about our long road to victory and peace and a new era in Azarbajan's history about how we managed to end the occupation through a liberation war and how we won peace by political means. For nearly three decades almost 20% of Azarbajan sovereign territory remained under military occupation by Armenia. 1 million of Azarbajanis were expelled from their homes as a result of the policy of ethnic cleansing and war crimes conducted by Armenia. Their fundamental human rights were grossly violated. Four United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993 demanded immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed forces from the occupied territories. Sadly, these resolutions were never implemented. Armenia demonstratively ignored them because no sanctions were imposed on it by international community. The OC Miz group established in 1992 to facilitate a settlement has failed in its mission. Instead of enforcing the norms and principles of international law, its co-chairs sought to preserve the status quo and keep the conflict frozen. In 2020, after almost 30 years of ineffective negotiations, Azarbajan was forced to exercise its legitimate right to self-defense under article 51 of the UN charter. During the war, Armenia shelled our towns and cities with ballistic missiles and cluster munitions, killing more than a hundred of innocent civilians. Azarbajan in its turn conducted the war in strict compliance with international humanitarian law. We ensured protection of civilians and refrained from targeting non-military infrastructure. In 44-day patriotic war, our armed forces liberated occupied territories and restored Azarbajan's territorial integrity in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The 10 November 2020 marked the capitulation of Armenia and restoration of Azarbajan's territorial integrity after nearly 30 years of occupation. Right after our victorious war, Azarbajan declared its readiness to open a new page in relations with Armenia based on mutual recognition of territorial integrity and sovereignty. We proposed five basic principles rooted in international law. We tabled the proposal for a peace treaty. Then we initiated a negotiation process on its draft text which lasted from October 2022 to summer 2025. Despite several attempts to derail the process, the negotiations produced positive results as they were conducted on a strict bilateral basis free from any kind of external interference. On August 8 this year, the foreign ministers of Azarbajan and Armenia in Washington in the White House in presence of the leaders of the United States Azarbajan and Armenia initial the text of peace agreement. The same day the president of Azarbajan and the prime minister of Armenia signed the joint declaration. President of the United States Donald Trump also signed it as a witness. Moreover, Bbajan and Armenia jointly appealed for the closure of the OC Mins group and related structures as an obsolute mechanism no longer relevant to the peace process. Accordingly, on 1st September, the OC adopted decision to permanently close these structures. Regional connectivity has been at the core of our vision for lasting peace. Another key outcome of the Washington summit is the Trump route for international peace and prosperity trip which will ensure unimpeded access through the Zenazer corridor and foster regional connectivity. The recent Washington summit has also signaled a new phase in Azarban US relationship. Together with President Trump, we signed the memorandum of understanding between the two governments regarding the establishment of a strategic working group to develop a charter on strategic partnership between Azarban and the United States. It opens new horizons for partnership in political, economic, energy, regional connectivity, defense, security and other fields. The waiver by President Trump of the sanctions imposed on Azarbajan in 1992 in the form of the section 907 of the Freedom Support Act is a historic step as well. The permanent removal of section 907 by the US Congress would eliminate a legacy of double standards and help strengthen trust and cooperation at a time when Azarbaijan is contributing to global security and stability. Overall, the agreements reached during my August visit to the United States carry historic significance. I want to express my gratitude to President Donald Trump for opening a new chapter in the US Azarbajan relationship for his decision to elevated to the strategic partnership level and for his support to the peace process between Azarbajan and Armenia. Right after the victory in the patriotic war of 2020, Azarbajan started large-scale reconstruction program in the liberated territories. During the time of occupation, Armenia leveled to the ground hundreds of Azarbajani cities and villages, deliberately ruined 65 mosques. That was a policy of Armenia which was ruled by war criminals for almost 30 years. We are rebuilding villages and cities raised to the ground. Under the great return program, already more than 50,000 people live, work, and study in the liberated territories. One of the gravest humanitarian challenges facing Azarbajan in the postconlict period is a landmine contamination during the time of Armenian occupation. Since November 2020, more than 400 Aarbani civilians and military personnel were killed or seriously injured by landmine explosions. This massive contamination obstructs the safe return of displaced persons and delays reconstruction projects. Similarly, the tragic fate of nearly 4,000 Azarbajanis who went missing during the Armenian aggression and occupation since the early 90s continue to require close attention and action. Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the global challenges we are facing, we believe that response must be inclusive, fair and universal. Through its many initiatives, Azarbajan shown its clear commitment to advancing sustainable solutions. Aarban is proud to have hosted COP 29 last year where we achieved important outcomes in advancing climate action, the green transition and equitable access to financing. As a host of COP 29, we guided negotiations towards ambitious and balanced outcomes, ensuring that all voices, particularly those of the developing world, were heard. The adoption of the new collective quantified goal at COP 29, also known as Baku Finance Goal, is a historic milestone in global climate finance. This commitment brings previous 100 billion US dollar annual climate finance goal to at least 300 billion US dollar per year through 2035 from public sources in developed countries to developing countries. Azarbajan also successfully finalized the long awaited framework for carbon markets under article six of the Paris agreement making the Paris agreement fully operational 9 years after its adoption. Several key agreements were signed at COP 29 to make the loss and damage fund fully operational, providing critical support for vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. Being strongly committed to the green transition, we at the same time should not put unrealistic targets in front of us. The world cannot live without fossil fuels today and in foreseeable future. Energy security is closely linked to peace, regional connectivity and economic development. Azarbajan continues to play a proactive role in advancing these objectives globally. Aarban has established itself as a reliable and indispensable partner in providing energy security to many countries. We play a strategic role connecting the Caspian region with international markets through diversified oil and gas pipeline systems. As of today, we are supplying natural gas to 14 countries. This ranks Azarbajan as the top country in the world in terms of number of countries it supplies with pipeline gas. This reflects our strategic role in enhancing energy security and diversifying supply routes across Europe and beyond. Moreover, Azarbajan and Syria have recently strengthened their bilateral partnership focusing on energy supply, infrastructure development, and postconlict reconstruction. Since August this year, Azarbajan started to supply Syria with natural gas via Turkey, significantly reducing its electricity shortages. Azarbajan also attracts large investments in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. Almost 40% of our energy will be generated by renewables by 2030. Connectivity projects like east, west, and north south corridors cross our country. We have witnessed almost 90% growth in cargo volumes through the middle corridor since 2022. The transit time along the corridor have been significantly reduced. the biggest trade fleet in the Caspian Alat International Trade Port with its annual capacity reaching 25 million tons in the near future. The Bakud Bilisi cars railroad, nine international airports, the biggest air cargo company in the region and many other factors have turned Azarbajan into one of international transport hubs. There is a great potential for cooperation in digital connectivity. Aarbajan leads the digital transformation initiative through such ambitious projects as the digital sukway. This project includes plans for the advanced fiber optic cable network under the Caspian Sea establishing Azarbajan as a key regional digital hub. Azarbajan achieves significant economic growth by focusing on diversifying its economy beyond oil and gas, developing the non-oil sector, and improving the investment climate through reforms and transparency. Reducing poverty and unemployment to the historic low of 5% is another achievement of our country. Recently two major international rating agencies Modis and Fitch have increased Azarbajan's ranking. Azarbajan was provided with favor favorable investment grade status c\r\n",

The federal government has unveiled the official theme for Nigeria's 65th independence anniversary tagged Nigeria at 65 all hands on deck for a greater nation. According to the office of the secretary to the federal government of the federation, the theme underscores the need for unity, collaboration and patriotism across all sectors in nation building. Activities include the Jamaat prayer at Abuja Central Mosque on Friday, September 26, a church service at the Ecumenical Center, Abuja on Sunday, September 28th, and a world press conference to be addressed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akum, on Monday, September 29th. President Bola Tinibu has directed the Bank of Agriculture to clear outstanding aras of 30 billion naira owed to agro dealers and impute suppliers under the national agricultural growth scheme and agro pocket. The order followed the release of funds from the African Development Bank AFDB and aims to strengthen support for farmers and stabilize the food supply chain. The Bank of Agriculture has been designated as the custodium of all agricultural financing program funds and has pledged to pay all compliant beneficiaries within 24 hours using its electronic wallet system. The bank stated that the payment represents the second tranch released by the African Development Bank to set obligations from 24 from 2024 dry season and wet season programs. The managing director of the bank of agriculture, Aayos Shotin, described the move as defining moment for the agricultural sector, adding that it will unlock opportunities for sustainable and profitable agro business. Beneficiaries are required to open a bank of agricultural accounts to access the fund while weekly progress updates will be provided until full completion of payment. Deposits by Nigerian banks with the central bank of Nigeria CBN under the standing deposit facility rose to a record of 3.5 trillion naira on Wednesday rising 38.34% from 2.55 trillion naira the previous day compared to the 348.8 billion naira a year ago. The figure represents a 164% jump. Analysts linked the surge to excess liquidity in the banking system with credit appetite and high lead high lending rate near 40%. The increase came a day after the CBN cuts its benchmark interest rate to 27% narrowed by the policy corridor and reduce commercial banks cash reserve requirements to 45% in a bit to lower borrowing cost and stimulate private sector credit.

After his graduation in 1961, Yun joined the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant and was later appointed lecturer of economics at the Cheetah College. During that time he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side. In 1965 he received a fullbrite scholarship to study in the United States where he obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University graduate program in economic development between 1969 and 1972. After his keen education, excellence of apex heights and proportions in the United States, he returned home and was appointed professor of economics at the University of Cheetah. He was eventually appointed onto the board of directors to the United Nations Foundation where he served for 33 years. When Bangladesh suffered a famine in 1974, Ununice felt he had to do something for the very poor in his country. He founded the Grammine Bank.

[Music] Akiwanduat Shuinka on July 13, 1934 in Abuta State, Southwest Nigeria stands as one of Africa's most celebrated literary figures and a global icon of resistance against oppression. His life and works reflect an unwavering commitment to justice, culture, and the transformative power of arts. Shuinka was born into a Euroba family in colonial Nigeria, an environment that exposed him to both traditional African culture and western education. His father Samuel Aayod Shuinka was a school headmaster while his mother Grace Enola Shuinka was a devoted Anglican. This blend of indigenous and colonial influences deeply shaped Shuinka's world. Shuinka attended government college Ibadong and later proceeded to the University College Ibadon where he studied English and literature. Shuinka completed his education at the University of Leed in England earning a degree in English and later a doctorate degree. In the late 1950s, Shuinka began working as a dramatist at the Royal Court Theater in London. However, his passion for storytelling and cultural preservation drew him back to Nigeria where he founded two theater groups known as the 1960 mask and the Oris Theater Company. Shuika's works, often the fusion of western dramatic techniques and African themes address universal issues of justice, freedom, and human dignity. His early play titled A Dance of the Forest, which was introduced in 1960, written to celebrate Nigeria's independence, critically examined the nation's socopolitical trajectory, setting the tone for his career as both artist and activist. Shuika's activism became more visible during Nigeria's postindependence years. In 1967, during the Nigerian civil war, he called for a ceasefire between federal forces and Bafran separatist. This led to his arrest by the military government and he spent 22 months in prison where he wrote a short drama titled the man died prison notes a harrowing account of his imprisonment and a profound critic of authoritarianism. Shuanka has authored more than 20 works including plays novels poetry and essays. In 1986, Shuika became the first African to win the Nobel Prize of Literature, an achievement that brought global recognition to African literature. Shika remained an unspoken critic of oppressive regimes, often at great personal risk. His activism extended beyond Nigeria, addressing global issues of injustice and human rights. During periods of military rule in Nigeria, he went into exile, continuing to write and speak against tyranny. Today, Shuika is celebrated not only as a literary giant but also as a symbol of resilience and moral courage. Palm oil has long been a vital component of Nigeria's agricultural heritage with roads tracing back to pre-colonial times. Originally serving local needs, its importance has grown exponentially, propelling Nigeria into a prominent global producer. Spread across regions like Edo, Delta, Cross River, and Uno states, the country boasts extensive plantations and advanced processing capabilit\r\n",

He is also a former managing director of Al Jazzer English. Uh Giles uh climate change is the defining story of our century. Still journalism is quite uh failing to fully engage audiences, create social impact and momentum for political action. What is your take and what is to be done to you know to to go forward? Thank you Jeppy. Um thank you for the invitation from HC Montreal and from Ry. It's wonderful to be here to speak to everybody. Um I'm Cameroon in Indonesia, Egypt or Maldona, Nigeria. Let me start. A free press is fundamental to peace. It is enshrined in the United Nations sustainable development goal number 16 which talks about promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and free press is fundamental to that. Professional journalists can help to facilitate peace by hopefully promoting tolerance. But let's stick to talk about journalism's role in peace with journalists themselves are increasingly under attack. In Gaza, for instance, the toll has been staggering. As of September the 1st, the Committee to Protect Journalists counted 189 journalists killed. Other organizations put the figure even higher, up to 247, according to the United Nations Human Rights Office. Journalism is not only dangerous in war zones like Gaza. It is increasingly just collateral damage. They are being deliberately targeted environmental society left in the dark. So why raise the climate issue in a forum on media and peace? Because climate change is not just an environmental challenge. It is humanity's most pressing long-term challenge. its many cascading impacts, drought, wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, and forced migration undermine stability and can fuel displacement and conflict as indeed Dr. Gregoire has just mentioned. In this way, climate change can drive violence. But the link between climate and conflict also works the other way. War worsens climate change. War devastates environments and ecosystems. It destroys infrastructure. It involves war machines burning massive amounts of fossil fuels. And it leaves the enormous carbon cost of reconstruction. And also war diverts focus pulling attention and resources and political will away from climate action at the very moment the world needs it most. The mission of journalism is to present facts and informed analysis to let people know what is happening in the world. Media journalists inform us about climate change. They inform us about the risks, the challenges, the consequences and indeed the solutions available. It media can help us better understand, better acknowledge and hopefully address the challenges posed by an overheating planet. So in these times, good journalism is in fact an essential climate solution. But is the media doing enough to cover the climate crisis? as indeed you asked Jeppeti. To begin answering that question, let's turn to six key truths and I took these from an article from the Yale program on climate change communication. So, six truths that we can use to start as a foundation as as a baseline for what is accurate and undeniable. The first truth is climate change is real. It's real. Climate change is happening. The second truth, it's us. Human activity is causing climate change. Thirdly, experts agree there is scientific consensus about human-caused climate change. Four, it's bad. Climate change harms people. It harms livelihoods. It it destroys livelihoods. It kills people. Five, others care. Many people, most people are concerned about climate change and support climate action. And sixth, there is hope. Action can be taken to limit the harm if we act now. So why isn't media doing enough? Despite the scale and the nature and the urgency of the climate crisis, my contention is that the media is not doing enough to cover the story. There are notable exceptions, but too often climate coverage is sidelined and demoted down the news agenda or in some cases climate change is not covered at all. So why is that? I will offer two reasons, two possible reasons. First, the fear of activism. The fear that some journalists fear being seen as activists. Some editors. Hello. Could you please put on mooch? Thank you. So, the fear of activism. Some editors worry that covering climate too strongly will look like advocacy rather than journalism. This is false framing. Reporting facts about science, about impacts and solutions is not activism. It is journalism's duty. Truthful reporting is not necessarily neutral. It needs to stand against corruption, against injustice, against disinformation, and against the erosion of truth. Secondly, a second reason why media is not doing enough. What I call the tyranny of immediacy. Newsrooms like audiences are wired to respond to sudden visible threats, war, scandal, disaster, Donald Trump's latest political outbursts. Climate change, by contrast, is often gradual, complex, and harder to capture in a single headline. So, it slips down the news agenda, even though the consequences are existential. Though, let's be clear, for millions of people around the world, climate change is neither abstract nor distant. It is immediate and devastating, destroying lives and livelihoods. There are efforts to address the media's gap in climate reporting and strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. One leading initiative is covering climate now which I um am uh a co-chair on the steering committee. It's a notfor-profit initiative and it's the largest media collaboration of its kind with over 500 partners media partners worldwide. Its mission is simple. To help journalists raise the quality, the reach and the urgency of climate reporting. Let me give an example. Here's something remarkable. In 2024, last year, a global survey published in Nature Climate Change found that 89% of the world's population want their governments to do more to address climate change. So, think about that. Nearly nine out of 10 people across continents, across cultures and political systems. The survey was across the world. So across the world, there's overwhelming agreement that more needs to be done. Yet most of those people don't know that they are in the majority. Instead, they may feel isolated, trapped in a spiral of silence that stifles momentum. and the and the full sense of isolation weakens collective action. If people knew that their views were shared by almost everyone, it could spark broader movements. It could pressure and inspire governments, corporations, industries, and and communities and individuals to accelerate climate solutions. And so earlier this year, Clevering Climate Now media partners across the globe, across the world joined in a joint coverage um around Earth Day earlier this year to report about this theme of the 89% majority. It was called the 89% project. Newsrooms collaborated to highlight the global consensus on climate action. The aim was to break the spiral of silence and remind audiences that they are not alone. This is a journalism as a force for peace and a force for good. Amplifying solutions and shared ground. So let me close with this thought. Journalism can and must do more to cover the climate crisis and journalism can be a voice for peace. But this mission is only possible if journalists themselves are protected, supported and empowered to tell the truth. Because in the end protecting journalists means protecting journalism and without journalism there is no truth, no accountability and no peace. Thank you very much. Um I have a question. How do you you think that new ways of telling the story, new storytelling, new journalistical techniques might help journalists who want to do more for climate uh bridge that gap. You know the their news rooms being wary about running those stories. The journalistical tools to brainstor in general and then individual journalists newsrooms in general. A great way is not just to have an environmental desk or an environmental reporter. Actually, climate is in all stories. Economy, um, national security, uh, in everything there is a climate angle. So, bring your climate in, bring your climate news into every story because there is a climate angle in every story. In terms of individual journalists uh covering climate now we we have a formula of three ways of covering a story. A good way of covering a story. Firstly humanize, localize, solutionize. Let me go through those. Humanize is find the human angle. Find find a person a character who can represent your story. We all we all love stories. storytelling, we we respond well and when we see other other people uh we respond well to stories that that are centered around people. Um localize is that although climate change is this big global issue, find ways to make it local as well. Connect the local to the global. Um and then thirdly, uh solutionize. If there are solutions, report them. That doesn't mean sugarcoat and create false hope but that you know there are many in many cases there are solutions. Um so often as much as it's a doom and gloom and negative story where it is appropriate and I underline where it is appropriate and where there are solutions let's hear about those solutions and let's rigorously analyze them and assess them to make sure they are real solutions. Thank you. Thank you Charles. That's very inspiring for our daily journalism, journalistic work. Now we have a few minutes for question and answers. So the microphone is open to uh the many many uh participants to the session. The floors is yours. Uh please uh madame sari please open your mic and ask your question. then it'll be time for Muhammad from RRI. Okay, thank you so much GCP. Uh I think it's really interesting um attending this webinar. What uh I really want to talk about is yes, I think all of us I agree that um media have a very crucial role in um promoting peace and climate change. But then what we need to think about is about this media. This media is often the main source source of information that the public relies on especially regarding to climate change and peace. Um, how should media organizations produce content on different issues in a way that informs and engage audiences without creating fear, panic or further tension? We know that reporting on climate change can sometimes create climate and fight or maybe hopelessness if it's too and conflict can accidentally inflame decision is framed with bias orism. I think this is um we need to talk about this how can we create any common sense or how we report the climate change and how we cover this sensitive issues without creating fear panic or further tension that's all my questions thank you so much who's that question for study uh I'm for the third for Giles yeah for the for okay thanks Thank you. Okay. Um let me just say I apologies my apologies. After sorry we'll have a question for Muamar. Then we'll have to go to Elen Astrai who's pressed to go. So uh then we'll have a longer Q&A later. So thank you for your patience. Giles please. Thank you for the question. uh uh I I believe as I said actually media is an essential climate solution because we need as as the uh question the the the asker said we need media to inform us of what's happening in the world so that we can really acknowledge the problem and then hopefully address the problem. We can't address the problem without acknowledging the problem and understanding the problem. Now your point about um doom and gloom and we don't want negative and we don't want to make things worse. Uh you're absolutely right. Uh we we don't want to people to lose hope. Um and as I said we we should give solutions where where they are and there are many solutions. There are many solutions but I have to say as a journalist we can't give false hope. So there's there's a balance. We can give solutions but we don't sh like we say we don't sugarcoat. We don't make everything sweet and sugary and nice. We are journalists. We have to tell the truth and be accurate about the situation. And the situation at the moment is not great. We are, you know, as the scientists are telling us, it's it's the world is really needing to address this problem. um many parts of the world are already suffering terribly from this situation. So I completely understand we don't want to just focus completely on the negative. Um we do want to give solutions where there are solutions but at the same time we as journalists we need to be responsible. Um it's and now on to Muamar Abdullah please be patient we'll come to your question after the intervention of Elanatino Who's the third speaker today? Thank you. Just be patient. Muhammad, please. The floor is yours. Hello. Asalam alaikum. Uh can you hear my voice? Yes, we can. Salam. Okay. Thank you. And I would like to ask to Mr. WGO actually uh he said that uh media play the roles in delivering uh the informations to the audiences and since uh he mentions the Africa so I would like to know do local languages or maybe traditional African instruments have impact in delivering the messages to the audience on radio productions because as we know that there are so many local or tribal languages in African region. Thank you very much. Thank you Moar Garv. Yes. Thank you. We have many languages and we broadcast in most of these languages. We don't broadcast in in all the languages. For instance, in we have more than 250 languages. Oh my god. We are the 250. I said languages you cannot broadcast in the 250 languages you spend all the all the time broadcasting on climate change. What we have done is what the the public media has done is to select the most important languages. Uh and the country has been divided in 10 regions and in each region you have two or three languages which are the most important and these languages are are listened by everybody. Everybody can can can hear what we are you are saying and in at the level of the the the Yaund the capital we broadcast in for instance in the case of Camun in French and English but there are areas like in Tanzania where they broadcast in Swain which is a local languages local language in Nigeria they they broadcast in Hosa in Sineagan they broadcast in Walof We we always use uh the local languages for the message because the what is important is that this message should should reach the grasshood. It should reach the people on the field because they are the one facing climate change. They were they are the one who has to take some measures to face climate change. So we use local languages but we cannot use all the local languages. we select the most important uh of them. I don't know if I have answer your question. Thank you Gregoire. Yes, that was a good question and uh Mr. Wano and thank you Mr. Solenas. Thank you. Thank you all. Now let's go to Elena Strainoli. Elena is a journalist from Ry Television. She works for a very very interesting indepth program that is called Presa. Um she specializes in repotage and often it's about crisis areas. But before we hand the floor to her, I would like to show her show you a trailer from her documentary that won the Global Peace Media Awards in 2024. Thank you for your attention. It's a minute and 50 seconds. [Music] [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] for cheese. for [Music] [Applause] [Music] someone So this was the trailer. Uh peace at all costs is the name of the program and it is about reconciliation. You cannot stop war with more war. That was the story and the example that Sierra Leon is giving to the world like South Africa has done in the past like other countries have been doing. So let's hear from Elena Strainoli. Elena, what was your experience shooting that documentary there especially when it came to peace building after conflict? Okay. Uh good morning and good evening everyone and thank you thank you Joseeppe for introducing me and thank you all for the invitation. Erh, I want to start from the beginning. Uh, in September 2022, uh, we were thinking about the new the episode of the new series of of our pro program called Preseta. Uh, the war in Ukraine broke out in February and uh, nobody was talking about peace. So while while we was thinking about how to address this topic, Ricardo Yakona, the host of the program told me to read a book called in Italian mechanics of peace. Uh we were looking for a proactive way to talk about the war. In the beautiful book I mentioned earlier, we found the history of Sierra Leon, a small country on the west coast of Africa which had a 20 year war that left thousand and thousand dead and wounded. A bloody and violent war. Uh after the end of this war, there were two paths to take. continue to the hatred or try to build a new state based on peace on peace at all costs. So we decided to tell the story of all these absolutely ordinary people who day after day in their communities decided to build peace. director Mateo Debo and I traveled from Freetown, the capital of the state, to the most remote inland villages, meeting dozen of people who work every day to defend the peace uh that has been built with hard work and dedication. It was a very very strong experience from an emotional and people who dedicate their life their lives to building peace. From these people I learned that peace is not a definitive goal uh but must be defended and protected every single day. Uh we met people as I said from remote villages who learned to forgive each other. uh because the war in Sierra Leon was really terrible. It was a civil war which pitted friends, brothers, parents and children against against each other. So they needed to rebuild trust, find a way to get people to talk and achieve forgiveness. I've been in villages where there had been dozen of murders, violence of all kinds and betrayals. Yet thanks to the work of a local NGO called Fambble Talk, these people managed to rebuild their social fabric, the social network. No, the for example, we met a woman in a small village. She told us that she had been raped by her neighbor's son whom she had known since he was a child. He had been forced to join the rebels and commit terrible acts as you can see at the small uh footage. You know the trailer. Yeah, the trailer. So in order to return to live together in the same village, they were forced to look each other in the eye and confront each other. They told, cried, argued of course, but in the end he apologized and she accept this apologize and every day he goes to fetch her water for example and take care of her little garden. He takes care of her a form of reparation for the harmy coaster. I met also Italian priest who built a school for poor children in the remote villages teaching them every day to listen each other and to talk each other. Uh this priest were already in Sierra Leon during the war. They were kidnapped and some fled into the jungle to escape death. But they all stayed. No one none of them returned to Italy. Uh no, don't worry. Please, the technical personnel, could you please re re go back to Elena? Uh we are having Joseph Abal on the screen. Joseph, please mute your microphone. Thank you. Little technical bleach. No problem. No worry. No worries. Go ahead. Go ahead, Elena. Thank you. So, uh I was talking about the Italian price. No. Um they stay they were kidnapped as I was saying and some fled into the jungle to escape that. But all of them stayed in Sierra Leon. No, none of them returned to Italy. They wanting to be there for to help the people they knew to rebuild the school destroyed by the rebels and to bring their words and works for peace. We went to the hospital of the NGO emergency. I think that everybody know knows emergency. The hospital is in Freetown is for poor people. They were sincerely on during the war and had to treat people who had had for example they had their hands sorry cut off or who had suffered gunshot uh once and all kinds of violence. They told us that it was very difficult but they too stayed for the local population. We would have lost everything without them. And so looking at these examples, I thought that peace and caring for others are very closely linked. And memory, of course, memory, I think, is everything. The memory of war and devastation must always be cultivated. In Freetown, there is the peace museum where photos of the victims are displayed, where the violence described and remembered, where photos of the militia leaders who committed war crimes are displayed. But above all, the museum reconstructs the long peace process that allowed Sierra Leon to come to terms with its past. Every year, hundred of children visit the museum to keep the memory alive. saw that what happened in the past will never happen again. At at the end of this journey in Sierra Leon, I understood that peace is very fragile and must be defended. It cannot be in it cannot be taken from granted for granted. And I believe that this lesson is useful for for everyone, especially for us Europeans who have lived in peace for 18 years and take it for granted, of course. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows up that nothing lasts forever and that we must defend what we have. I've been asked if I consider myself a peace journalist. I don't know really. I am a journalist and I believe our job consists not only in talking about wars, catastrophes and negative things but also and perhaps above all in talking about and describing the good things, the solution to problems. I believe that world is full of good people. people who build peace in their own small way. We as journalists we must give them a voice otherwise we risk being overwhelmed by by mistrust and cynism. Thank you Elena. Oh sorry sorry no I have a question for you. You said that peace is nurtured by memory and caring for others and it is built every day. Your program is also very active in the on the climate front. You do investigations very frequently. Do you think that also climate change awareness and fighting climate crisis is built every day by people and journalists? Yes, of course. Of course. I think that um our role as journalist is uh to shine uh a light on those who speak of peace, of climate change, of people who do something for change things around us. At preset we always try to report things in a different way. Even when we talk about issues for example such the environment, health, work and gender issues for example, we always try to take a human and constructive approach [Music] focus on human beings with their demands, needs and specific characteristics. I believe that we must keep people at the the center of our narrative along with rights we have won and the society we have built. Uh because I I think that the the risk of a return to totalitarianism is very serious. And I think that as journalists we are under attack. Yes. Every day we live in Italy. Italy as I think as people know we have drunk mafia a lot of colleague died for reporting because they write around about these issues for example about drugs no and I think that we need uh we we we have to try to search the truth and fight for the truth because I think that truth is the only tool for peace and uh for for defend our democracy. Thank you. Thank you, Elena. Elena mentioned Andrangeta and mafia. That's the organized crime in Italy, mostly dealing in drugs, but also doing business. And Elena is courageously reporting on drug uh on on drugs in the south of Italy. Thank you for your contribution. Thank you and sorry because I can't stay with you uh for the entire duration of the meeting today. I'm sorry. Very sorry. Thank you very much for your contribution. That was great. Thank you. Byebye. Okay. Bye-bye. And now it is time for question and answers. We have a few hands uh raised. Please keep them. We have a queue here. Abdullah Aljanath from Ararai was waiting from for has been waiting for a few minutes. Abdullah, please uh the floor is yours. Please unmute your your microphone. Can you hear me, sir? Yes, we can hear you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Sir, what is your question? Also say who it is for. Okay, sir. Greetings from Bangladesh, sir. I'm I'm an engineering journalist from Bangladesh. uh in I am now my question is from the point of view of journalism and social conflict in my society we believe all men are created equal and true equally mean on the basis of the character a man should be judges so on the point of uh true equality how can uh journalism uh contributed in our society this question and my another question is uh in shund bone is the largest mangro bone on the earth who which also save us from various catastrophic catastrophic cyclone and any other problems. So he a lot of foreign save the sunund bone which is the largest mangro bone on the earth. So how can we get and collaboration to save the uh I have a question on the on this global platform. Thank you sir. Thank you. Uh it is from your uh uh Jer I'm asking Mr. Gile. Okay. For Giles. Okay. Question sir. Yes. Yes. Yes. The question is for Giles also. Now the floor is open to the other speakers. So if Kuar or Javad would like to intervene as well when we when questions are posed please do. Giles. Well, basically Asia is faced with so much uh stress from climate crisis and how to fight that please. Yeah, thank you Abdullah. I'm sorry the sound was was not very very good so I didn't catch everything you said but in terms if you were talking about the stress of being a journalism and and mental health. I think it's a really important topic that we need to address and that is um mental health uh not just of journal I I was a journalist in in war zones and I had uh post traumatic stress syndrome PTSD and that that was many years ago that was from being in a war zone but now um you have many journalists who are facing the stress without being on the front line they are face Even in the newsroom they are they are seeing footage unedited footage of war of climate disasters and I think we have to be aware of the mental health of journalists and the psychological stress that journalists face. Of course um you can um we train journalists we provide um support psychological support in whatever way counseling counseling support many media have to do this but many media don't and so I think the the mental health of journalists is really important um to take to take care of because it is increasing and there was a a recent study a recent global study showing that the cycle psychological stress of journalists is is increasing because of the dangers, the risk, because of the terrible things they are seeing. So, it's a really important topic. Thank you, Giles. Uh note to all participants, if you you will be able to find on the chat a message from Muhammad Kabal from Rarai. He had some suggestions uh on top of what Charles has already explained. Uh now more questions from uh Dion Utami from RRI. Please Dian, the floor is yours. All right. Uh thank you very much. Um I'm Dian from RRI Palo and here I'm going to ask for um Mr. Giles. So uh in recent conflicts uh there are so many examples of uh the journalists uh in social conflicts. We have seen uh in so many media outlets accused of bias and journalists being targeted under disputed claims. In our role as journalists or media stakeholders in global peace dialogues, how can we insist on neutrality and protect in independent reporting and ensure that legal and ethical safeguards actually work even in um even under political pressure. So uh what do you think about that? Thank you. Thank you Deian. very very very important question and um as I said journalism journalists are under increasing attack um we've seen recently in Gaza some terrible situations some of my old colleagues uh who were killed um deliberately targeted not just killed by accident or by crossfire they were deliberately killed they were targeted uh there are there are what what can be done. So there are firstly we have to work with organizations who are protecting who who are um providing information about journalists. For example, the committee to protect journalists, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, all of these are uh tracking and monitoring and logging the the killings of journalists and that's very important. We have to and the United Nations UNESCO are doing the same. We have to put pressure on governments to act so that there is no impunity because um a lot of a lot of um either states uh governments, states or non-state actors are getting away and with murder by killing journalists and so there's no accountability. So we need to demand accountability. Another very important thing is media organizations need to stand in solidarity with each other. When a journalist is killed from one media organization, we need other media organizations to stand up and support and be standing in solidarity. Unfortunately, um, recently in Gaza, we saw some journalists killed and there was some, um, disinformation that they were terrorists or that they were supporting terrorism and these these these claims need to be checked. What was happening is some media organizations were were just paring the claims without verifying, without checking. Um, so they were they were they were repeating the propaganda of of the party that had killed the journalists. As journalists, we need to verify and so we need to stand in in solidarity with each other. Uh, I think that's that's so important. Um, and it's it's it's getting increasingly more important that media organizations show solidarity because one journalist killed somewhere is an attack on all journalists. Thank you. I hope that so thank you for that question. It's really important. Thank you. Thank you. Can I add something? Yes, please go ahead. Yes. I believe that uh there are two aspect of these questions. first of all what we have to do as journalists and secondly what the others can do to protect us. We journalists first of all we should uh refuse to involve ourself in this uh how can can I say editorial lines which are brought by governments by people and so on and groups we have to remain professional we have an ethics we don't have to involve ourself in things that will bring us out of our our ethics and a journalist had that's for me the best way of protecting ourself. The second aspect I don't believe in the uh with what is happening in Gaza and so on. I don't believe in the capacities of organization of journalists to protect journalists. I don't believe more again to those things. What my point of view is that the government and the organization like United Nation should involve themsel should commit themsel in the protecting journalist because this is one of the the right the right of human being the right of human being we the the the freedom of expression and so on and this organization are the only one who and protect us. But when government uh are they the themselves involved in bad practices where the the the United Nation is becoming weak and weak weak and weaker journalists are like if they are under a rain the big rain without a protection is that's the situation and now we are talking about all those things because they are happening in areas like Gaza and so on. But I would like to tell uh to everybody here in Africa we have been facing this this type of thing since where journalists are killed nobody will do anything journalists are arrested nobody will do anything they are in prison nobody will do anything. So we have as our organization as as journalists to call for the protection of government and the United Nation and we ourself we have to avoid all what is bias. We have to to stay h strongly on our ethics of journalists and remain professionals. Those are the two aspect of my my my answer. Gregoire, we have a question on the on the chat of this uh meeting. It's from Mahadevi from Ararai,...",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:movement is total freedom and emancipation now. It's not total freedom and emancipation in our lifetime. We are looking for total freedom and emancipation now. That is the principle that is the clarion call that is going to drive all of us and that shapes the nature and character of everything else that all members and structures of Africa may be involved in. So whenever people come with challenges of water, of collapsed infrastructure, of education, of unemployment, what we think as Africa may movement is what we do now. We do not plan that no don't worry those things they take time to resolve. So the idea and thinking that must drive all of us is what do we do? M. So it's total freedom and emancipation. M that is the clarion call that that drives all of us as to what do we do even on areas where we cannot do anything but we must have solutions now. There's no tomorrow. Everything else that has to be done is total freedom and emancipation. Now that is the clarion call of Africa my bu movement and that is why in the introduction of the restoration manifesto there is a quote by Amla Cabral who says that always bear in mind that the people are not fighting for ideas for the things in anyone's head. They are fighting to win material benefits, to live better and in peace, to see their lives go forward, to guarantee the future of their children now. So that is the clarion call that then deals with where we come from. Now the first part of the restoration manifesto emphasizes what we have just emphasized now which is to say that this document is the restoration manifesto. It is the founding document which gives political ideological and organizational compass of Africa may be movement. So a compass is a navigator. So compasses were used before the electronic navigators were there to say that this is the direction that you take. So the compass, the navigator of Africa may be movement is this restoration manifesto which calls for total freedom and emancipation now. for inch. total fra and emanip. No. And then the last part if I read you won't believe that I'm saying the correct thing because it's in the because it's in the language is the koi language and it emphasizes that this restoration manifesto is the product of the people. It is the resounding acre of collective wisdom forged in the trenches of shared struggle. A tapestry woven from the threads of cuminal dreams and unyielding resolve born not from isolated egos but from the pulsating heart of the masses who refuse to bow to tyranny. It shuns the vanity of selfabsorbed elites. those or ivory towers dwellers detached from the blood, death and sweat of real lives and instead arises as the unfiltered voice of the oppressed. The blueprint carved by hands hardened from labor and hearts scared by injustice. demanding that Africa is restored to her true guardians. So that is the essence of the introduction. So comrades, we're going to talk to what is highlighted in each and every section of the restoration manifesto so that all of us we have an understanding. Then the next section that starts on page five deals with the question of where do we come from as a people and paints a correct picture that before the arrival of colonial settlers. We were not sleeping on top of trees and under the rocks as the indigenous people of South Africa. We had order. We had organized systems in the pre-colonial history. There is proper evidence that we were even involved in the extraction of mineral resources and also involved in global trade as well. And we have to emphasize this point because if you go to all the bookstores now majority of the books that tell the history of South Africa, they start in the year 1652 when Jean Fanic and the colonial settlers arrived in South Africa. So majority of history books that exist about the history of South Africa is not the history of South Africa. It is the history of white people in South Africa. So all the historicization of the history in South Africa is the history of white people in South Africa. So we are retelling it to say that before the arrival of colonial settlers, we had systems, we had governance systems, we knew authority, we were involved in subsistence farming, were able to generate food and we could distinguish between wild and domestic animals. That is the reality which you must and we must never ever believe that we only got to know civilization with the arrival of white colonial settlers. We were a people with order with systems before the arrival of colonial settlers. And of course the colonial settlers came. The first tried in the year 1510. So the first attempt to colonize South Africa began in the year 1510 in what got to be known as the battle of the the the Salt River battle. And the first attempt to colonize to occupy this part we call South Africa today was done by the Portuguese by because they were the dominant force in the world. So in their global trade from Europe with the Asias, they used to pass through the Cape and use the Cape as a stop station and then proceed to engage in different trade with the Asias. Then there was an attempt by a Portuguese colonial settler called Francisco de Alia who tried to colonize South Africa but he was defeated in a physical war by those that he tried to take the land of. So the first attempt to colonize South Africa did not start in 1652. It began in the year 1510. So you will see that the Portuguese ultimately succeeded in the colonization of Angola of Mozambi because when they were traveling on the coastal lines, they will always try to take over those land parcels. They tried to take South Africa but they didn't succeed because our forefathers resisted that colonial invasion. And then of course in 1652 there was a colonial settlement which began as a stop station of a company called VOC like the Dutch East Indian company which had the full support of the Netherland government uh an army to colonize our country and when the colonial settlers took our land there was resistance. Those who were had the land fought back to say you can't take our land. You can't take our animals. But they were defeated because the colonial settlers had superior armaments. They had superior weapons. They had guns. dead bombs and ourselves were fighting with the spear. That is why in the logos of almost all liberation forces in South Africa, there's a spear as a symbol of resistance against colonial settlement. all together comrades I don't want to the so that is we were so there were many battles in the war against colonial invasion so you know in a war you have different battles that take in place in different areas and in different time periods There were many battles. Some were worn by our forefathers but very few. But the war of colonial invasion, the war to resist colonial invasion. We did not win that war. Our forefathers did not win that war. Those who tried to fight through organized political parties from the early 1900s up to this day, we have still not won the war. We are still a conquered and defeated people by colonial settlers. And how do we know that we are still a conquered and defeated people? We see that because of the landlessness. The land still belongs to the descendants, the grandchildren, the great grandchildren of the colonial settlers and invaders. Majority of animals are owned and controlled by the descendants of colonial invaders. Almost all our precious and industrial mineral resources and metals are owned and totally controlled by the colonial invaders. We are still slaves in our own land. We are still suppliers of cheap and easily disposable labor to the colonial settlers and their descendants. So we're still a conquered people. So that is what the history part of the restoration manifesto deals with and of course gives recognition of those that fought against colonial invasion, those that fought physically. Those that resisted, those that surrendered their bodies were defeated. Those that tried to form political formations to resist colonialism also did not win. And we make mention of the fact that part of the reasons why the colonial settlers defeated us is because they never there was never a period where they fought us as a combined force. I would I are together comrades. So there was never a time where we were fighting against colonialism as small separated clans and kingdoms. There was never an African or South African army which said let's resist these people. They fought us separately and then they were able to subjugate us and defeat all of us. And the defeat is still a reality. We are still a conquered people. Erh we can we can we can say it whichever way but materially was still under colonial rule. Even the manner in which the economy was designed still serves the colonial interest. So if you check the railways the infrastructure not only of South Africa of the entire African continent all the rail projects move from the areas that have got mineral resources to the ocean to supply the colonial settlers and the colonial masters. There is no real projects that interconnect all of us so that we can interact amongst ourselves. So the colonial economy is still a lived reality and we explain that those they have they fought with spears and at some stage after the arrival of the first colonial settlers from the Dutch then the British came in then they annexed the whole of South Africa. And in the late 1800s, the Dutch settlers and the British settlers fought amongst themselves. They fought within themselves like they had something we called they called the Anglo Bua war. But it was not just Anglo and Bua warriors. There were a lot of black people who were co-opted on both sides who were sent as mercenaries to fight the Anglo Bua war. There are so many black people who died in the Anglo Bua war fighting the war which has nothing to do with them. And in the year 1902 when the Anglo and the Bers settled they resolved the war. They said let us form a white only government and exclude these blacks. And then they started to write the laws of that country and then they agreed amongst themselves that this new entity which they going to call the union of South Africa is going to be under British colonial protection. all together comrades. So that that they say that yes physically there were lots of casualties from the booers and the Dutch seem to be not interested in supporting the booers. So let's agree that let's form a white only government which is going to be under British colonial supervision. That is why the law that established South Africa in the borders that it has now was passed in the year 1909 as the Union of South Africa act by the British Parliament in England. And then they were merging the two Bua republics which was Transval and the Orange River Colony with the two British colonies which was the Cape and the Natal to form what is called South Africa today. And that was a white only government that excluded black people from participation from meaningful participation. And the understanding was that this union of South Africa is a colonial project of the British Empire. So the head of state of South Africa from 1910 when it was launched was the king of England. And those that were doing administrative works It's a I saw. is a pill. Now, thank you very much. It was a necessary break comrace that we had to take. was still explaining the fact that South Africa was established by an act of parliament passed in the British Parliament as the Union of South Africa act. That act is still you can search for it in the internet. The Union of South Africa act which established South Africa India. Now there's interesting things that happened before the passing of the union of South Africa act that when the booers and the English were fighting amongst themselves they had a national convention like a national conference of men only 33 men to say how do we resolve this question and then they state. Let us form, let us merge these four provinces into one country called the Union of South Africa. The head of state will be the British Empire. Whoever is a king or queen, they will be the head of state of the union of South Africa. And then the others will be prime ministers. And then because there were four provinces, they then said they can't have one capital city, they must instead have three capital cities and then the other province will be prioritized in terms of the infrastructure which it needed to be prioritized that time. As a result of that colonial settlement, the Transval was given the administrative capital city in Ptoria. So it's a colonial agreement that Ptoria became the capital city of South Africa administratively and then the legislative capital of South Africa became Cape Town on behalf of the Cape Colony and then Bloom Fontaine became the judicious capital on behalf of the Orange River Colony and then the Natal was given a project which they had to finish as part of the priority programs that were being engaged in at that time. So the fact that 1994 did not change that colonial agreement, it's confirmation that was still a colonial project because it's senseless to have three capital cities. It's politically and administratively burdensome to have legislators at the far end of South Africa and then you say you have got a democrats which must involve everyone in terms of participation. It's impossible now if there's public submissions that have to be made in parliament for many parts of South Africa to get to the Cape. But if there was logic, a capital city ideally should be at the center of the country so that everyone else is able to come there. But we are living under a colonial agreement of the Anglo Bua arrangement. So the reason why the capital city and the head of state operates from the union buildings the union that is the union of South Africa as in the union of South Africa act. So we we we are still in that. Then we narrate the history of resistance against the union of South Africa. The first attempt of course was these traditional leaders and the black middle class which said let us found one organization to resist the colonial union of South Africa. So before the 1912 January 8 formation of the South African natives national congress there were congresses in other parts of South Africa in the orange river colony there was an organization of the free state congress led by mika in In the Transval there was a congress led by Sifako Mahad. In the Natal there was a congress led by John Langalle Dub. Then they started negotiations to then found the South African Natives National Congress in Bloom Fontaine because Bloom Fontaine is central. So Bloom Fontaine is the most central city in South Africa. So logically wherever was coming from whichever part of this South Africa they then met in Bloom Fundine to found the South African Natives National Congress on the 8th of January 1912 which was renamed the African National Congress in 1923. Two important things to highlight about the formation of the South African Natives National Congress. It did not have fundamental objections to the Union of South Africa act. It actually did not. So the ANC formation did not object to the Union of South Africa and including the fact that it was going to be under British rule. They were fighting for inclusion of some of the black people within the Union of South Africa. And this is not fiction. It's things that you can read in their foundational documents. They honored and respected the British royalty. Even when they sent delegations to England to ask for inclusion into the union of South Africa, they will say we are under your leadership, oh king. We worship you. I'm I'm fine. So the at for atformation atformation. So So you must go and retrieve the contents of the ANC petitions to the British royalty. They were saying no just accommodate the educated black middle class and those that have got proper don't include everyone but some of us who are we we speak like you sound like you maybe the has achieved what it was founded for because it was never about the total liberation of everyone. Of course, with time the nature and form of the struggle changed. So we then give so comrades we explained that in the part of the history section that the struggle for our freedom and emancipation is like a relay race. So you know a relay race is what those young men from Botswana did in Japan in the world championship. So the first one runs and hands over the button to the next one. Then they take the button to go to give to the other one and then the last one runs towards the finish line. the in the struggle for freedom. We take it like that that we are not the originators of the struggle for total freedom and emancipation. We taking the buttons from those that fought with spears and were defeated. We're taking the buttons from those that formed political parties. We are taking the bur from the generation of freedom in our lifetime. Now comrades since formation the ANC was conservative and was always by the way even their conferences were opened by representatives of the colonial government that no we hear you about the Christ we have we are aware that you went to Britain there are some rules that were going to we wish you well in your conference but you must tell us what are your resolutions that is what used to happen but then the turning point in the struggle methods began with the generation that defined itself as the freedom in our lifetime generation of Robert Mangalis of Maji of Nelson Mandela Oliva of Walter Cisul that generation said that this method of fighting in respect and in fear of the colonial government must come to an end. Let's engage in confrontational battle of defiance first. Let's defy the colonial laws. Let's adopt a perspective that is going to articulate our vision and aims as to what type of society do we want to build in uh South Africa. That is why on the 26th of June 1955 the freedom charter was adopted which said that South Africa belongs to all who live vinid black and white and which also said that no government can claim authority over the people unless it is unless if it is based on the will of all the people. That was a radical departure. So you know and it also said that the mineral wealth beneath the soil the banks and monopoly industries shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole. And in that time that was too radical to say are you saying that we must all vote that is too radical. That is why the uh that is why the the freedom charter was banned and everyone else who associated with the freedom charter was considered to be to be a terrorist. So to to have a copy of the freedom charter was you are a terrorist automatically. To associate with the aims and objectives of the freedom chart meant terrorism. And because of the freedom charter, everyone who associated with the freedom charter were arrested in what became known as the treason trial. So it was tasinous to associate with the freedom chart. Are we still together comrades? And then the freedom charter led to the burning of all the liberation forces and then it led to the formation of the army. is with the army that is as an armed resistance against against the apartheid. So we're explaining this relay race of who fought and what happened. But an interesting development as well which the historicization or the history books even of the ANC conveniently suppresses is the role that was played by the Panaffricanist Congress of Azania and Robert Mangaliso Subukqu because after the adoption of the freedom charter there is a ction of the freedom in our lifetime generation that said we cannot associate with this thing that says South Africa belongs to all who live in it black and white. South Africa belongs to us black people only. That is what the panafricanist component said. And then they founded the panafricanist congress of Aania in Souto in 1959. And in 1960 then they led the anti-pass defiance campaign which was in Sharpville and in other parts of South Africa. A lot of people were killed because of that struggle that was singlehandedly inspired and led by Robert Mangalisu and that changed the course of history in South Africa. that changed the course of history in South Africa. It led to the burning of political parties. It led to the formation of the army. And when all the liberation forces were suppressed, the voices that rose came from the black consciousness movement with the formation of the South African students organization in 1968. human. The uh so when there was a vacuum of liberation politics in South Africa when the parties were banned, leaders exiled imprisoned. There rose a young revolutionary called Steven Banu Bo to found the South African student organization. And from campuses, the black consciousness movement got to influence the whole of society in the struggle against aparate and colonialism. Almost everyone who joined politics and participated in politics from 1968 in the early '7s almost all of them were organized under the black consciousness movement. So that includes mutant includ all of those people who joined during that period. will later on to join the but they were first organized under the black consciousness movement. The black consciousness movement founded an organization called the black people's conversion in Marisburg in 1972 and elected a president Winfred Hui from Tabanch. Wow. Wow. From Tabanch Winfred Hu. Actually, when we spoke about Winfred Huare, the founding president, president of uh Dr. News, when we spoke about Winfred Huari, the first president of BPC, one of the family members reached out to say is the first time they hear someone speak about the first president of the BPC publicly. And that conference of the BPC then designated Steven Banu Bo as the lifetime honorary president of the BPC. But the most important thing that took place there was the adoption of black community programs. So the BPC says yes we are a political party who are fighting against aparate but what do we do now then they adopted black community programs on health care on the economy on creation of jobs now on education so if you go to King Williamtown there's still a Zanmpilo clinic which was founded by the BCP programs, the black community programs which were under the black consciousness movement and of course the black consciousness movement inspired the June 16 uprising in Suto to resist the imposition of Africans as the medium of instruction. action the June 16 uprising which was condemned by the ANC by the way. So the official statement of the ANC after the June 16 uprising was that these kids are reckless. Why do they want to protest like that? They are reckless. But June 16, 1976 got to organize a lot of young people all over South Africa and it got the apartate ruling class to reconsider aparate as a method of capitalist exploitation. June 16, 1976 got the ruling class to reconsider aparate as an instrument of capitalist exploitation and amassing of resources. That is why after June 16, the Openheimras and the Roberts constituted an organization called the Airban Foundation which was beginning to discuss how do we involve black people in future South Africa. So if you check who were the employees and the people who associated with the air foundation, they include the tanto tanto the first beneficiary of be tanto montan but they also Alo included the current president of the ANC. So the urban foundation of the openheimers and the rupetss are the ones who funded the current president of the ANC to buy a house and to buy a car that time in the 1970s. It's it's a it's in books which he has signed. So when kids were being harassed by apartheid, he was applying for loans from the Openheimers and the and the Ruperts and Hope not being with them in terms of what got to happen. And we know comrades that the escalation of mass protest and everything has led to cordasa which was the conversion for a democratic South Africa to negotiate the transition. But in the part of the history in the section which we're talking to here in the restoration manifesto we acknowledge the role that was played by the workers. We acknowledge the role that was played by women in the antipass campaign in 1956. to acknowledge the role that was played by the churches that as part of the colonial project was an attempt to make black people see God through white people or through whiteness. But you had forces that said we can't associate with that. And that of course was illustrated by the formation of the Nazareth Baptist Church in 1910, the formation of the Zion Christian Church in 1924. But earlier there were Ethiopian churches that were founded by Mangana Mukon in 1892. The formation of the International Pentecost Holiness Church in 1962. The formation of the Bantu Methodist Church in 1933 which got to organize majority of the people because colonialism included the fact that people must see God through white people or through whiteness. And there was resistance from amongst our people. And then of course I did explain 1976 escalated negotiations and then the white capitalist system approached the ANC in exile to say if we were to give you government what are you going to do with it? And the ANC says no we're going to continue with whatever was happening there. Then they said on that condition we will give you government. Actually in the year 1987 one of the senior idols of the openheimers clam Santa said that at the end of the day negotiations should work rhetoric must be dropped and business must continue as usual. That is how the ANC went to Cordesa. Even when FW DLC released Nelson Mandela in the speech in 1990 and other political party and other political prisoners and also unburning of other political parties. He said in his speech that we are going to negotiate on the foundation that capitalism is going to continue, free enterprise will continue unabated, unchallenged in the contents of the speech. So the manner in which this transition happened was on conditions and foundation laid by the oppressors. That is why we have not worn our freedom totally. we went to negotiate a a battle that did not belong to us. So that is basically what the and then of course cordessa happened. What cordessa did was to compromise the liberation ideals of total freedom. They said, \"We're going to take political power, but we'll leave economic power in your hands.\" Even that political power, we don't want all of it. We just want part of the political power. Otherwise, yourselves, you must continue to work with us here so that you can teach us how to run government. The sunset losses meant exactly that that the ANC was babysitted by the aparted government from 1994 when it took government onwards and once they realized that this baby has grown according to the shape that we wanted they said you can go ahead and do it by yourselves because you're doing it correctly. That is basically what happened with the the transition of South Africa. But in Cordesa as well, something that is not mentioned is that the ANC's approach to traditional and royal leadership was that it must be either destroyed or subjugated to civilian nonhered rule. That was the approach of the NC because the the characterization of traditional leaders in allc documents was that traditional leaders are collaborators of aparate. That is why when they came with municipal systems and structures act they redemicated South Africa differently. So you find villages that are cut into half some one one part of the village belongs to this municipality and the other one belongs to the other municipality. One part of the village belongs to this word, the other one, the other word and then the words are given three four village. The word counselors with utmost power over counselors and then traditional leadership institutions turned into tokens. It was not a mistake. It was a decision. So it was a decision that as that is why even government planning when they deal with IDP it's word based not village based and you find in a in a word there is five villages then they go to one village and then they say what do you want there they're fine we have covered what two and have not spoken to other that is why villages are still trapped in a perennial and persistent levels of underdevelopment and and destruction of the basic infrastructure that existed before because that is what got to happen. And of course 1996 the ANC passed a policy called growth and employment and redistribution strategy called gear which privatized state-owned companies and gave more and more economic power to white people. and and since the ALC took power in 1994 this way you can see that nothing was done in an excellent and impressive way. The education system is not perfect. The health care system is nowhere close to adequate. Joblessness is worse than what it was under a partate. The few industries that used to exist in the rural areas, all of them have closed down. Public infrastructure is not maintained. the municipalities or the so-called municipalities that they have created are all dysfunctional and that is what brings us to the next section of the restoration manifesto the diagnosis of what is the problem with South Africa and these come from the observations that came from the people now comrades we highlight that there is 100 issues that are identified there. So the section asked a question why Africa Maya movement exists as a political party and movement and then it says the diagnosis of the problems and it says that the primary reason and purpose why Africa Mayua movement exists is because a substantial number of the people of South Africa in post 27 said it should exist as a movement to address the multiple crisis confronting society. So that is the primary reason. Then there's 100 reasons. We say that even if it was one of those reasons, there was basis and foundation to could form an alternate movement and the reasons start by the fact that our people are still landless. Just land only can form the reason why you should constitute a different movement. Landlessness, joblessness, highest inequality in the world. White people are getting richer. The colonial settlers are getting richer and our people are getting poorer. access to natural resources. We make a point that why is it that the extraction of mineral resources is reserved to multinational large companies only? Why are we not allowing artisal and smallcale mining in South Africa and in a safe environment where we say that for this piece of land you can extract chrome, you can extract gold and have a livelihood out of it. An example is given. Do you know in there was a case that they were were dealing with of a member of the community who was arrested for taking a wheelbarrow of coal in a malathing coal will long trains and wagons take our coal to the ocean every Tons, thousands of tons, millions of tons are taken every day. But our people are not given access to the basic resources which are supposed to define our riches. The levels of crime, gender based violence, education system, healthcare infrastructure, food insecurity, undermining of royal and traditional leadership, marginalization and mistreatment of people with disabilities, super exploitation of workers, a national debt which is not manageable. that government continues to borrow money which they are unable to pay back and that will be a burden to future generations. 100 reasons on why we have to found a different movement. The NC was given 30 years to become an alternative and it's not. It's worsening the problems of our people and an objective political assessment and analysis that we have made all of us is that in the space where the ANC has failed. Who else is supposed to come with durable solutions? We have got two larger ...",

The strong rely not only on power, but on strategy and resilience. Every battle for existence leaves its mark on this land. And only those who adapt earn the right to continue the story of life. The African savannah burns under the harsh Sunday. From afar, a roar shatters the silence echoing across the parched grasslands. It is not just a sound. It is a challenge. A battle for dominance is about to unfold. In the world of the lion, power is never given. It must be taken earned with razor sharp claws and a fatal bite. Young males exiled from their prides roam the harsh land awaiting their chance. They form coalitions targeting powerful prides ruled by aging alpha males. When the moment comes, the savannah trembles, roars thunder through the air as the battle erupts. Claws tear, fangs strike, and the thick manes offer little protection against the fury of the challengers. In this brutal world, only the strongest survive. Only the victors have the right to shape the future. Lions can be ungainainely in the trees. But on the ground, they not only steal kills, they seek to eliminate other predators. Even the much smaller African wild dog is seen as a rival. And in the lion's world, all competition must be destroyed. Wild dogs will normally do everything they can to steer clear of the great cat's path. But should a lion catch their scent, it goes on the offensive hunting with a single purpose annihilation. Silently the lioness approaches and then she strikes. In the chaos, the ever watchful pack has left its pups undefended. By the time the adults return, four of the young are dead. She has no intention of eating them. The lioness leaves the bodies a cold warning to stay out of her path. This behavior seems brutal, but with fewer wild dogs, there is more food for the future of the lion's pride. Scientists even have a name for this leonine strategy of threat and intimidation. They call it the landscape of fear. And it extends over all other great predators that have the arrogance to cross a lion's path. As the first rays of sun touch the floor of the Ingorangoro crater, a majestic landscape is revealed. The perfect stage for mortal confrontations. Around the wetlands of the Goring Swamp, herds of African buffalo move in silence, gathering in tight formations for mutual protection. Yet from deep within the dense tall grasses, a pair of sharp eyes is watching. It is the lion. It observes its prey with a calculated calm, ever ready to launch into the hunt with agility and resolve. But no attack is easy. A powerful charge from an adult buffalo could seriously injure a lion. However, this is not just a confrontation between two species. In the sky, a Rupel's Griffin vulture circles, waiting for the moment to clean the remnants of the battle. On the ground, hyenas fertively prowl, seeking a chance to steal the prize from the one called the king of the plains. The Ingorongoro Crater is not only a masterpiece of nature but also an unforgiving battlefield for survival. Here every creature from the most powerful to the most discreet contributes to the magical balance wisely ordained by creation. Located in northern Tanzania, the Angorangoro conservation area spreads like a living canvas of wildlife covering over 3,100 square miles. It is a unique wonder of the planet recognized by UNESCO as a world heritage site for its incredible fusion of ecological and cultural values. The name Ingorongoro originates from the crater itself, a colossal geological structure that symbolizes the deep link between time, ancient geological layers and the unceasing flow of life. Every rock stratum, every stream, every mountain range here tells the story of how nature has formed, transformed and endured through the ages. The Ingorongoro crater lies in the heart of northern Tanzania, a majestic remnant from the passage of ancient time. 2 to 3 million years ago, a colossal volcano stood here, its height rivaling the world's tallest peaks. until a decisive moment when the volcano erupted violently, releasing an immense volume of lava and collapsing in on itself. The hollow core could not bear the weight of the summit, causing the entire structure to fall, creating a vast depression. This caldera with a floor of 100 square miles and a depth of 2,000 ft is what we know today as the Enorangoro crater, the largest intact volcanic caldera in the world. Not only surrounded by majestic mountain ranges, the Enorongoro conservation area is also a true paradise of biodiversity. Every element from rivers and wetlands to grasslands and woodlands is interwoven forming a complex yet resilient ecosystem. Today, this area remains one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. Here, over 25,000 large mammals are part of an eternal cycle of life. Each species plays an essential role in this complex yet harmoniously balanced ecosystem. creating a picture where every detail has meaning. The endless grasslands stretch out like a living tapestry where thousands of herbivores gather, bringing vitality to a constantly moving landscape. The velvety green grass not only feeds the large animals but is also a refuge for insects and tiny creatures. These small inhabitants perform vital functions the soil decomposing organic matter and supporting the natural cycle of regeneration. The Ingorangoro Crater with its rolling green plains is a stage where wildlife unfolds like a neverending drama. The Eningorongo crater with its vast space and unique ecosystem is one of the most exceptional habitats for the lion. Known as the king of the savannah, a symbol of power and authority, the lion has evolved over millions of years to occupy the highest position in the food chain of grassland ecosystems. However, in the enclosed environment of the Enorangoro Crater, the lion's story takes on a different hue where geographical isolation and constant survival pressure create unique challenges and opportunities. The lion originated about 2 million years ago initially in Africa and once expanded into Asia, Europe, and even the Americas. Today their range is almost exclusively confined to subsaharan Africa and the Enorongoro crater hosts one of the most stable remaining populations. The caldera with its 100 square miles and surrounded by steep walls over 2,000 ft high forms a self-contained ecosystem where lions are relatively protected from external threats. The lions living in the Enorangoro crater are noted for their large size and extraordinary strength. Adult males weigh from 330 to 550 lb with a body length of about 5 1/2 to 8 ft. Meanwhile, females are lighter and more agile, weighing from 265 to 400 lb. The lion's body is perfectly designed for hunting powerful muscles, strong jaws with sharp teeth, and incredibly effective claws. Their pale tory coat acts as natural camouflage allowing them to blend into the savannah environment. The male's mane is one of the species most striking and iconic features. Thick and dark, the mane not only symbolizes strength but also indicates reproductive fitness. Lions with darker manes often have higher testosterone levels, making them more attractive to females during the mating season. Additionally, the man serves as a natural coat of armor in battles over territory or for the protection of the pride. here. The lion excels with its superior strength and lightning fast attacks. Although typically living in a pride structure, lions do not always hunt in groups. When hunting alone, they tend to select smaller or less defensible prey, such as small antelope species. With a speed that can reach up to 50 mph over short distances and the ability to leap up to 36 ft, a lion can close the distance to its prey in just a few seconds. A small unit of lionesses, often two to four, will lead the hunt. Once close enough, one lioness suddenly bursts forward, causing panic and forcing the herd to scatter. The other lionesses quickly close in from different angles, isolating an individual from the herd. This strategy requires not only individual strength but also precision and synchrony among the members. is not always victorious. Their hunting success rate is only about 30%, especially when facing powerful prey like the African buffalo. In this enclosed caldera, the buffalo not only plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, but also stands as a symbol of life, unity, and collective defense. The large herds move slowly under the gentle sun, creating a seemingly peaceful scene that belies a constant readiness against any threat. The African buffalo has evolved over millions of years to become one of the continent's most powerful and adaptable herbivores. Today they are widely distributed in subsaharan Africa from vast grasslands to dense wetlands in the ingorangoro crater. Buffalo find an ideal habitat, lush green plains, abundant water sources, and a relatively low level of external threat within the caldera. Herds of African buffalo often congregate near rivers like the Mongi and Oloyuki or around the wetlands of the Goring swamp. The buffalo population in the Angorangoro crater remains stable at about 4,000 individuals, forming one of the highest densities of buffalo in Africa. The buffalo possesses a powerful physique perfectly adapted to the harsh conditions of nature. An adult individual can weigh between 1,100 and 2,200 lb, reaching a length of up to 11 ft. Their curved horns, which can be up to 5 ft long, are not just a symbol of strength, but also an effective defensive tool. A thick coat and well-developed musculature help the buffalo withstand harsh climates and enhance its defense against lion attacks. African buffalo tend to live in large herds, forming a cohesive network that allows them to protect one another from predatory threats. Each herd typically numbers from 50 to 500 individuals maintaining a stable and wellorganized social structure. Buffalo usually move at dawn\r\n",

And when we first began Oh, are So if we have been discussing brieing contributions and someone raises the hand or goes to the microphone and says Mr. Chairman I call a question. When you say you call a question what you mean you are telling chairman it is enough now can we vote and the chairman will listen to you in favor that is not yours that is for the chairman those ones now I'm using here in favor you will hear him saying those who are in support of the motion that's what it means the chairman will always say those in favor you have heard the chairmans the way they were just saying here then you can say who is those opposed opposed means those who do not support that motion then there's another language that we use here those who support can you say I can you say nay that's just a language to say yes we are in support when you say I you are saying we in support when you say nay then you are saying we no we are not supporting the motion then you will hear the chairman Now say carried. When he says carried, he is not going to lift anything or a back. He's only saying the motion has been supported by the majority. Then he says carried. You cannot say carried yourself. Even if you know it has been carried, don't shout it. That is reserved for who? For the chairman. Henry is the only way. Even if you are so happy that it has gone and you can see clear it is the majority you don't say carried the chairman only will say carried he will say carried then some motion some motions uh need simple majority while others need a two majority or even more for them to be said carried the chairman will determine when a motion has now been supported well according to the constitution provisions. Especially if you say if he says those in favor say I I those in oppos say nay nay and he feels maybe he cannot judge that whether the eyes or nays as the majority then he can choose another option of voting but usually he is allowed to determine from the eyes and ns to judge and declare whether it is carried and if it is not current he can say defeated. defeated is to say the motion has not been supported by the majority of the members. Has not been supported by the majority of the members. When you hear chair is not this chair. You can say chair just alone or chairman. That's a short way of saying when you say chair you are saying an individual who is chairing the meeting. So anytime you say chair that's what it means. and floor the floor here is in the process now of all under discussion the one in the floor is saying that those you hear of those languages Mr. Chairman, I would request because it is at length and we included even the general conference uh rules of wonder which were were begun in 1985 and I want to believe the members have read all this.

He was actually the host until he was taken from us and we were very happy Mr. President that you were able to look in East Kenya and beg pastor Fidaris Chuma. Please may you greet us. It's no longer ours. uh is now belongs to ECD and uh this is ECD and East Nairobi field in East Kenya Union Conference. We are very proud.

God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Uh Pastor Juma uh we are sorry that we have assigned you here. We assigned you before you were chosen. uh because this this was supposed to take place on the 31st of uh uh August and before that time and we had prepared even the booklet and it went that way we still have that honor and you know east Kenya still mean east Nairobi I've not released you fully until the end of today thank you sir you may be seated uh Dr. Joel Okindo is the assistant, the president in charge of ministerial and other assignments in the division. You may greet us. Hallelujah. Amen. We are glad to be home. I'm so honored, Mr. Chairman, for the privilege you extended to me to be part of this important meeting. My prayer is that God's presence will be with us and we will behave and act as a conference should. There is a way we are anticipated to be mature and may that maturity be be be felt and experienced in the way we run these meetings. It will go a long way to bring hon and glory to God's name. Thank you. Uh may I invite the and officers please come here. We are inviting you here so that you are live and they can see the one talking um Jackson Mr. Jackson CPA Jackson Olango is the under treasurer of East Central Africa division. In the arrangement of the general conference, there's the treasurer, there's the under treasurer, then there are associate treasurers and assistant treasurers. So his position is next uh to that of the treasurer who I will introduce shortly. And Jackson Olango is uh the associate not the under treasurer of East Central Africa Division. Please Jackson. Good morning. I'm happy to be home. uh for EXCOM members. I think we have interacted a number of times and um we are thankful to God for the face of community that we can see this morning and we expect that this face of community will give glory to God by the time this meeting is over. We do not just want us to appear to be a community that is struggling to hold but a real community sorry a real community that is actually holding to the glory of God. So we have a lot of hopes that when all is said and done all of us will leave here thanking God that we have seen the hand of God and may God bless you. Amen. And uh Mr. Lango was uh the liars officer. You know the division assigns uh officers to oversee in financial matters and before up to the time he was appointed under treasurer he was the lion officer and the treasurer will give us who is now our new lion officer but we'd want to have him still Mr. Treasurer that he becomes a lion officer. He did very well and we are very grateful about it. Please you may be seated. Uh Dr. Um Ellie Alicia Ogal is the executive secretary. Ah not executive secretary and secretary and secretary. is the same same level as that of the under treasurer and secretary. You know, I keep confusing because there was a time when he was the sec executive secretary under me. So, it is still in my mind. Uh but he's uh uh he holds a very important role at the division. is under secretary and that is next to the secretary that I will introduce later Dom Tom Ela. Uh please greet us. The Lord is good and all the time. The Lord is good and that's his nature. We thank him for bringing us together. We thank him for his church and for calling us to belong to this church. the church is his and we pray that we always act with circumspection without realization. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now I am moving to the uh next level. I will uh bring one by one. Uh let me begin with the pastor Johannes Holana. Uh please come here. Pastor Jiannes Holana is the treasurer East Central Africa Division. Please have it have the the mic. Um, Pastor Wana is uh our treasurer uh East Central Africa Division that uh covers all the countries of the division and he's here with us today. We are very grateful to welcome him. Please pastor Johannes Solana, CFO, East Central Africa Division, greet us and uh give us some wisdom. Good morning to all. Morning. May the Lord guide us and bless us as we do his business today. Amen. now is the executive secretary uh of the division. In those serious meetings in the corporate world, we call him the general secretary or the corporate secretary. And uh he's the man of God, Dr. Moses Maka. and Moses Maka is with us. And uh to appreciate the diversity as we said when we were praying I would just repeat that uh uh Jackson Dr. Tom uh uh pastor Chuma Dr. Ukindo all come from this country. Uh pastor comes from the great country of Ethiopia. Those of you who did some history and they were not allergic to history, you know it was the only country that was never conquered and uh it is the only country that has connections and you can find it in the Bible. Uh it comes from that great country. Now the one about to address you and he will be the one to address you because uh the president uh has all the prerogatives to address meetings but there is always something that the adventist have crafted they call him it is the president or his design. So after having introduced him he will be the design of the president to talk to us about uh matters spiritual. So after I finish I will bring the uh the the president he has already told me he has designated to him uh then he would make remarks after that and then we shall be ready to continue with the meeting. Dr. Maka comes from the great country of Uganda. The great country of Uganda. Please Dr. Maka, greet us before you take the bodium. You will sit and then we'll invite you. The Lord is good and all the time. The Lord bless you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Um now now um the chief of the hill we call him the chief of the hill because ECD is built on a hill and is the chief of the hill. every place, all these fields and conferences that span from Sudan all the way to um Rwanda, Burundi and then Tanzania, then Somalia and all these countries and fields and mean unions and union missions and attached fields. secretary. They are under the supervision of the man of God. If we begin to introduce him, we shall begin introducing him from the time the cows go to grace and the come cows come back from graci and that is none other than Dr. Brascius Ruguri. Uh please uh you may come here. Um Dr. Guri, a man of God, a servant of God who has taken this church for many, many years from one level to another from an insignificant and non division that was struggling from 203. And everybody was wondering whether this baby they gave birth to will ever survive and now it has come to the level where everybody is talking about it. For those of us who go to the the those international meetings Dr. is here. Now we say there are two terms they use that East Central Africa Division is the largest division membership wise in the entire world and not by a small difference by a big difference by a big difference. uh 203 it was insignificant. Nobody was talking about it. But now everybody is talking about it. Things are happening here. People are flowing here with all the initiatives that come from this place that has sparred the growth and movement of the church to that level. I'm talking about Dr. Prasia Sugguri. Now when we started we were being helped by by the general conference by every penny including salaries because we didn't have the money we were just we had come from EAD we were struggling there was no asset distribution so we we depended everything but now they use another term which started about 3 years ago I don't know whether three years ago pastor Johannes or two years ago that now ECD is called a net giver. Net giver means we don't receive the money. We now give the money to other mission fields in the world and that is a place under the man of God Dr. Precious Guri and he has worked in all levels of this church and in most of these he has worked as a church pastor as a school headmaster as a department director from the conference field then union then division and now he's here and as he stands here he's not only the president of east central Africa division is also the um vice president to the general conference. He's one of the 13 uh vice presidents plus the general vice presidents. Pastor Ruguri, we are very grateful as East Kenya Union Conference to host you and to have you. We are very grateful that you found time and you are here and he has assured me he's going to be here until he's told to go. Please greet us and uh but don't make the remarks now. The remarks will come later. Hey, that's right. But thank you very much u chairman for the privilege. Like many have said, it is really a privilege to be part of a convocation like this one. You may not realize it, but this is a very, very special setting made in the bo...",

Please let us be on our feet as we pray. Let's be on our feet. Psalm 104:33 says, I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. I want you to lift up your voice. If you know that you are a living being, if you know that you are alive today, lift up your voice with a grateful heart and begin to sing a new song unto God. Begin to appreciate him. Magnify his name. Exalt him. Somebody is not talking. Somebody is not saying anything. Let God hear your voice. Worship him. Appreciate him. Exalt him. Thank him. Thank him for giving you the opportunity to be alive today. Thank him for the gift of life. It is by his mercy that we are alive. It is by his mercy. It is not by our work. Let us lift up our voices and begin to thank God for his mercies over our lives. I want us to thank God for his faithfulness, for his goodness. The Bible says that his compassion fail not. They are new every morning. Great is his faithfulness. Lift up your voice and begin to appreciate God. For great is his faithfulness over you, over your life, over your family, over your business, over every aspect of your life. Say, \"Thank you, Lord, for protection. Thank you, Lord, for preservation. Thank you, God, because I can call upon you. Thank you for every time I call upon you, you answer me.\" Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Say, Lord, thank you for bringing me here this morning. Thank you for making it possible for me to connect here this morning. Say, \"Lord, I thank you. I appreciate you.

You are going to give me a new story to tell. Say, Lord, I thank you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your faithfulness. Thank you for your kindness over my life. Blessed be the name of God.

In every area that I've been denied one thing or the other, Lord, use the service today to restore me. Use it for my restoration. Use it for my restoration. Oh Lord, the restoration of my health, restoration of my platform, restoration of my business, restoration of my children, of every aspect of the life of your children. Every area of your life that you are desiring testimony that you are desiring restoration in what area have you experienced loss?

And as so, I want us to put our hands together for God as we welcome the living voices. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just lift those hands and bless Jesus this beautiful morning. He's worthy. He's worthy.

Let's go before him and start worshiping him. Give yourself, give your heart, give your soul. Let there be any other thing in your mind now except God. Be mindful of God. Worship him. Tell him you love him. Worship him. Oh yes. Be on your face. Be on your feet. Be on your knees. Be on your seat. Anyhow, worship God. Be free. Worship God. Adore him. Magnify his name. He is worthy.

Thank you father in Jesus name we worship. You have given him praise. He will raise you. He will bless you. There is always a miracle at the other side of praise. Now that you are praising, enter your miracle. Enter your blessing. Enter your greatness. This body you use in worshiping God will not know sickness. This voice you use in praising God will never go down. These eyes you lifted will never go blind. What God has not yet done, he will soon do. Today's encounter will take you to a new level in Jesus name. It is time to now confess what we want to possess. That's our progression on prayer mountain. We come into his gate with thanksgiving in our heart. We enter into his court with praise. Then we worship him individually just pouring out your heart. When we get before God here, we act like babies. Our age, our education, our cars, our houses, are they really ours? He's the one that gave them to us. We use everything to worship. Then we confess his word into our lives. These are spiritual steps. These are keys. We call what we want to see. Don't allow situations and circumstances to force themselves on you. You are the one that must be the master over situations. How do you do that? You confess it. Call your things what God calls it, not what your enemy want it to be. Are you listening? Yes, sir. Everything we come here to do to land, take it with you home. Operate your life like that. It will end in distinction. Don't tell your body, I am sick. No, that you have pain does not mean you are sick. The enemy wants to put it there. You reject it. Don't say I am poor. I am common masses. No. Those who said that in the wilderness they say we are like grasshoppers. God said moan them down if that is what they want. Joshua and Caleb that said we are able. Then he gave them ability. You are able. You are rich. You are healthy. You are fruitful. You are anointed. Amen. You are a giant. You will fulfill purpose. You will get there. You will add value. You will leave legacy. You will have a great family. How you should be saying to your life every day. Stretch out your hand to receive. Close your eyes to avoid distraction. Say with me wherever you are now, this is my day. This is my d\r\n",

These targets represent China's best efforts based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Meeting these targets requires both painstaking efforts by China itself and a supportive and open international environment. We have the resolve and confidence to deliver on our commitments. Colleagues, great visions require concrete actions. Climate response is an urgent yet long-term task. Let's all step up our actions to realize the beautiful vision of harmony between man and nature and preserve planet Earth, the place we call home. Thank you. I thank the president of China for his statement and now welcome her excellency Ursula Fander Lion, president of the European Commission to come to the podium, President Lula, Secretary General Gutes, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, indeed 10 years have passed since we adopted the Paris Agreement and since then the world has changed. Let me give you just three figures. Since Paris, renewable energy has increased by 140%. Investment in clean energy has increased by almost 80%. And carbon pricing in countries has doubled from 40 to 80. So the clean transition is moving on. And let me assure you, Europe will stay the course on our climate ambition. Our emissions are down nearly 40% since 1990. They now represent only 6% of global emissions. We are on track to reach our 2030 target, that is to cut emissions by minus 55%. And I'm happy to announce that last week member states agreed that our national determined contribution would range between 66% and 72%. So work is advancing and we will formally submit our NDC ahead of COP 30. But in parallel we are also looking ahead. We're working on a 2040 target of a proposed 90% emission reduction. That is our way to climate neutrality by 2050. And my message is that the world can count on European Union's continued climate leadership. My second point, we're doubling down on global partnerships because the question is no longer if the transition will occur and how fast, but who will benefit. Europe's answer is clear. All countries worldwide should reap the benefits, especially the most vulnerables. And that is why we will remain the world's largest providers of climate finance. In addition, we will mobilize up to 300 billion euros to support the clean transition worldwide through our global gateway investment program. And we will turn our collective agreement to triple renewable energy by 2030 into a reality. We support, for example, over 300 million people in Africa to give them access to electricity and clean cooking. And this is not only a climate issue. This is about basic human dignity because no mother, no child should die because simply cooking dinner under abhorrent circumstances. Ladies and gentlemen, President Luna will soon welcome us to the Amazon, the green lungs of our planet. There could be no better place to reaffirm our strong commitment to multilateralism. So, let's get it done. Thank you very much. I thank the president of the European Commission and welcome now his excellency Ray Tarip Erdogan, President of the Republic of Turkey. Distinguished heads of state and government, Mr. Secretary General, I greet you all with most heartfelt feelings. I wish Brazil success as it prepares to host the 30th climate conference in November. The climate law which we adopted last July uh was a significant step for us towards reaching our 253 net zero emissions target. Our endeavors to establish an emissions trading system, implement a green finance strategy, and to create a national green taxonomy are all ongoing. We have built our climate policy on seven pillars. Energy, industry, buildings, transportation, waste, agriculture and forestry. We have also formulated our second nationally determined contribution to cover all sectors and all greenhouse gases through the policies to be implemented in the economy. We aim to achieve an emission reduction of 466 million tons by 2035 and to lower our emissions down to 643 million tons. While increasing the share of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, we are expanding lowcarbon technologies in industry. As of this year, we have raised the share of renewable energy within the total installed capacity up to more than 60%. 205 three I'm sorry we are rapidly reinforcing our infrastructure particularly electrical electric vehicle production and we are prioritizing railway investments in line with our 203 net zero emissions target we will continue to transform our key sectors now access to international financing and cooperation in the field of technology. Both of these are essential to be able to achieve these goals. I would like to underline particularly that our water efficiency campaign and the zero waste initiative led under the opices of my spouse Emina Arduan and elevated to the global level. Both of these play a critical role in our fight against climate change. And we hope to crown all these efforts by hosting the 31st COP conference of the parties in 2026. So with these thoughts in mind, I wish this climate summit to yield beneficial results and I once again extend my greetings to you all with kind regards. I thank the president of the Republic of Turkey and now ask his excellency Anthony Albanese, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, come to the podium. Well, thank you very much, Secretary General. Colleagues, this is the decisive decade for acting on the environmental challenge of climate change, but also seizing the economic opportunities of clean energy. We all grasp the scale and the urgency of our task. We all understand the consequences of inaction for our environment, for our economies, for our people's way of life, and for our children's future. Australians know the toll taken by extreme weather events becoming more frequent and more intense. the devastation that cyclones, floods, bushfires, and drought inflict on our communities. And Australia knows that we are not alone. We are all involved. An essential message that each of us can send to our citizens is this. It is not too late. If we act now and move with common purpose, then we can do more than just guard against the very worst. we can protect our environment and build a stronger and fairer economy for the next generation. That is the optimism and determination that Australia brings to this task. And today I present Australia's next nationally determined contribution. Australia's 2035 target is to reduce emissions by 62 to 70% on 2005 levels. This target is ambitious but importantly it is also achievable. It is backed by the independent scientific advice of our climate change authority. It will mean that over the next decade we have our current level of emissions and it will ensure that Australia honors our commitment to the Paris Agreement and its goal of keeping global temperatures below dangerous levels. Setting targets and showing ambition matters. It provides accountability for government and certainty for private sector investment. What is most important is having the practical plan to reach our goal. And that is where Australian clean energy is the key. Just as our traditional resources have helped to power the extraordinary economic transformation of our region, our renewables can underpin new prosperity for the growing economies of the Indo-Pacific. And our Pacific family is partnering with Australia in our bid to host COP 31 in next year. We want to bring the world with us on climate change. Not by asking any nation to forego the jobs or security that its people deserve, but by working with every nation to seize and share those opportunities. None of us can succeed alone, but together we cannot fail. I thank you. I thank the prime minister of Australia and now ask his excellency Serenel S. Whips Jr. President of the Republic of Palao to come to the floor. President Lula, Secretary General, Excellencies, colleagues, distinguished guest, it is my distinct honor to speak to you on behalf of the 39 members of the Alliance of Small Island States, whose people are the most vulnerable, living daily with the stark reality of climate change, rising seas, stronger storms, and changing ecosystems. are not projections for us. They are our lived experience and they threaten our very survival. This summit is a key milestone on the road to COP 30, a COP at which the outcome must be nothing less than transformational. It must deliver new commitments that keep us firmly on the pathway to limit warming to 1.5. The science is unequivocal. This is a critical decade. Delay is defeat. Every fraction of a degree beyond 1.5 brings irreversible loss, especially for the vulnerable people of small islands. We come here with firm expectations that new climate commitments in the form of of 1.5 aligned nationally determined contributions would be submitted in time to be included in the synthesis report ahead of COP 30. And I must speak plainly to major emitters. Your leadership will define the outcome. Those with the greatest responsibility and the greatest capacity to act must do far more. Align your economies with 1.5. Phase out fossil fuels and exhilarate the transition to clean energy. and ensure that your actions inspire confidence, not doubt in the multilateral process. The recent opinion from the ICJ has reaffirmed that what OOS has long said, climate action is not optional. It is an obligation grounded in international law and in the principles of equity and justice. The world must look to this opinion as a moral and legal compass underscoring that failure to act is failure to meet international duty. Excellencies, the measure of leadership at this summ\r\n",

So let's go into the details of all of this to see why this is unrealistic, unfair, and even politically confusing. Let's see. My name is Toi. Welcome to my channel. Please like this video. Give it a thumbs up as you're watching so YouTube can recommend it to more people and kindly share it as well. To all my returning subscribers, you guys are amazing. You're welcome back to today's video. If you're yet to subscribe, please click on the subscribe button right now. Thank you. So, here it goes. Reform UK has announced it would abolish the rights of migrants to qualify for permanent settlement in the UK after 5 years if the party wins the next election. Under the plans, migrants would need to reapply for new visas with tougher rules. And Reform would abolish indefinite leave to remain, which gives people rights and access to benefits. Reform has also said it plans to bar anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare. If you're saying that people are going to keep renewing visas for every few years, what kind of visas are they going to be on? Are they going to continue being on that visa on the Skoda visa or would you create a new visa? Maybe call it a temporary permanent visa or something like what visa are people going to now be on that they would have to be renewing every 5 years and will you tie them down to one particular employer? What is the plan? Are they going to keep renewing the visas forever, you know, or would they have to like what exactly is the plan? Because sometimes I feel like these people don't really think things true just for political sake. They just come out to say some things without thoroughly because all these plans they are laid down plans that have been put in place to make sure that all of these things are happening you know like or all of these things come to pass right like somebody comes on a skilled worker visa and then after 5 years you get your ILR and then after that you get in to remain they have plans all those phases. So when you now want to scrap all of that, will you now put new things in place and how are you going to make that happen? And also what about the money that people have already paid for indefinitely leave to remain? If you're going to abolish that and take that away, it means you have to give people back their money. So is it also in your plan to refund every single person that have paid for ILR all the money that they spent? people already have in mind that after 5 years they will get ILR and these are the things they need to do to qualify. You write the exams, you write your life in UK test, you apply for ILR is over £3,000 now for one person. Okay, so imagine a family of three or four that have paid for everybody and they are all on their indefinit right now and then you now come out or at that time and then you now come out to say oh no sorry we're taking it back. You're going to take it back. Okay. Yes. Are you still going to give them back the money that they spent? And even if you give them back the money, what you now expect us family people to do? What do you want want them to do? Because it's possible that at that point maybe their visas would have expired, their visas. Okay. It's possible that a lot of things like they've already planned their lives and future knowing that they already have definitely live to remain. So if you're going to take that away from them, what kind of visas are you going to put such people on? and on that visa you going to create new restrictions or new rules and regulations for such visas because you say you're going to create tighter rules you know new visa with tighter rules and everything how is that even going to be possible you know and this even bring me to my next point you know most times when we talk about migrants in the UK they think it's only blacks and Asians that are migrants no we have Americans Australians Canadians right people from these people are also here on indefinite leave to remain Right. So if you're going to that means it's going to affect everybody. Even those from Hong Kong, we all watched the last last debates. We all saw it. But those that watched the ILR petition debates, right? You saw how Hong Kong people were highly represented. That's to show you that they have numbers and people that are well represented. So if you're going to take out ILR or abolish take back ILR from everybody that you've given to given ILR at that point that you want to do that form has also said it plans to bar anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare we don't even assess welfare normally so so under the current system migrants can apply for independ to remain after 5 years given the right to leave study and work in the UK permanently but it is a key route to getting British citizenship and allows people to claim benefits. He said it will replace IL with visas that force migrants to reapply every 5 years. Is that going to be forever? That includes hundreds of thousands of migrants currently in the UK. Applicants would also have to meet certain criteria including a higher salary threshold and standard of English. That's already was here. Yes, we keep talking about migrants. Mig it feels like every politician now they forget to talk about the economy, talk about the NHS, talk about every other thing that is bordering this the country other than migration. Like it feels like migration or migrants is just the only problem of the UK right now. And legal migrants are not really the problem. That's what I want you guys to understand. But politics playing politics will just not let them see beyond the surface. Legal migrants are not your problem. We are contributing to the economy as well. Like we are here doing good, helping, contributing to the society and the economy. We are not even entitled to public funds. We're not taking anything. We pay for our houses ourselves. We pay for our feeding our everything. Even we pay for IHS fees. We pay our taxes even for our healthcare. But when you talk about migrants, the way they speak about immigrants, the way they talk, it seems like every one of us have committed offense. And it's not fair anymore. These people have to start giving credit to who credit is due because honestly I know yes is the UK is their country their rules their laws but at the same time we all are human beings. Like is it that you don't want migrants to breathe anymore? You don't want migrants to think. You don't want migrants to just you don't want them to do anything. It feels like once you're being called about to talk everything is migrant. We saw the Conerative Party as well, right? The leader of the Convictive Party, everything she keep talking about migrants cuz we all saw when she said that she's even going to extend British citizenship to 10 years, she's going to do that and do this like like what exactly is the problem? Want to do anything or make rules or regulations, you know, for the benefit of your people, of your country, that's fine. But stop rubbing it in our faces as if legal migrants are the problem. because migrants applied for visas and it was this same government that granted these visas. Okay, you are the ones that said you have shortage of staff and you want people to come in and fill up these gaps and people applied legally, applied for those jobs, got it, followed the due process, applied for their visas, paid all the money involved, got it. These people are not illiterates. You know, he keeps saying that these people are lowkilled workers as these who are the lowskilled workers. Is it nurses, doctors, engineers, construction workers? Who exactly are the low-skilled workers? There are skilled migrants, highly skilled professionals. So the way they talk about ILL like it's something that is just handed over to somebody for free. Getting ILR is already very strict. The process, the regulations, the rules, you have to show a lot of things before you can get ILR. Of course, you have to have met the rule of staying in the UK for 5 years, at least five years. You have to pass the life in the UK test. You have to pass the English test. You have to show good character, no criminal records, all those things. You have to prove and show all of that before you before you'll be considered for your indefinite leave to remain, right? But they talk about it like it's just peanuts. And then we pay through our noses for it. It's very very expensive. is one application that if you know a lot of families are not careful would leave you broke or take you back to square one is very very expensive people that apply for ILR and get it people that are qualified for it so many skilled and educated migrants have come to solve the shortage of staff or shortage crisis in different sectors I think it's high time legal migrants started getting respected because like what is all of this is tiring you turn on the news today and trust me it's not only just affect ing adults as well. It's going to affect children because everywhere you go to it's this the grants are doing this do that like is migrant the only problem of the world. What's going on? I understand that there are a lot of locals that don't even support these things you know these things that politicians are doing reform UK is not even in power yet they don't have the powers or the numbers to make such drastic change. So why make such a statement? See migrants are contributors. Okay, legal migrants especially are contributors. They are not the enemies. Okay, migrants work in the NHS, construction, you know, different sectors in the UK, social care, different sectors. They are building families, paying taxes, buying houses. So like what else do you want? And these numbers that you guys keep talking about that there are lots of you know the numbe\r\n",

Okay, we've heard them about emergency and we are moving to declare security zones and the president is saying that all these are at our disposal. The state of emergency is at our disposal but we we believe that what we've laid down now must work. Say that. Okay. Nobody has said that. In fact, the president did not say that. He the president said we have to move one step at a time. He said he will consider it as a last resort. Yes. Would you say we at the last resort? We have not gotten to that point. I think our plan is working and I'm saying to you, I was just on the Ankorra River just last week. 190 kilometers of the Ankorra River. I I I rode on almost oneird of it for three hours. And guess what? Left and right, there were people who continue to do GP, pump the water out and pump the poison back into the water and and this was last week. Yes. Yes, of course. In some of these areas, listen, this fight has taken over six regions with over 4 million people engaged in the art. Okay? And I'm I'm being honest with you. I am telling you that this problem is not going to be solved by aua alone. And it's not going to be solved because suddenly we come in and the next morning is gone. You see that turbidity levels the depth I've described it will take time to come back to the turn blue. It will take consistent effort. It will take the efforts of the community there. You know when I left what I did, I went to all the communities. I brought the chiefs and I asked them this is your community. This is where Shamfan machines that destroyed the water bodies are being manufactured right on the Anobra. I'm saying is that we are now backing this up with permanent army. You heard me warning that we are moving another step further and that step says we are going to declare all the water bodies and our forest security zones and you stay there and engage. Okay. So 17 minutes past the hour of the honorable minister lands natural resource. So clearly uh government has positioned again uh to move to another step and the step is that they declaring river bodies forest areas as national security zones environmental engineer or environmental engineer sorry the University of minds and technology environmental and safety environmental and safety um department. So clearly it tells you everybody seems to know you just heard the minister say clearly and I just wrote it here sir political apparatics I mean well Dr. on this on this matter but maybe Dr. on that morning clearly environmental and of course uh being at the University of minds and technology there it tells me sir uh there's much upper hand when it comes to some of these things but clearly let let me take your first um uh h on this one your your your your initial comments on what is really happening transpiring when it comes to where we've gotten to as we speak They can get. What has really happened? I want to know. Can you be clear? Oh, okay. So, uh there are certain commitments. One has to do with the other has to do with rivers. The other has to do with excavators from the other one has to do with security. Now the other one minister said yesterday they declaring river as a national security zone and they're going to put in permanent security people affected areas. He was even declaring almost about six regions are affected when it comes to this galam. So clearly these are some of the you have said exactly what I also know I think we on the same page. Sure minister the political players involved involved to bring the country this far. They should give him a break and that he is willing and ready to solve a problem. I think this is a very passionate voice. There is no punishment for the perpetrators. We know them pay. What is being their responsibility? The government is putting a lot of initiatives. No Ghana. A time will come there will be no Ghana. I don't know what we will have but we will not have the Ghana we know and we are just hoping say it will be as a good intention we expecting it to be. environment and technology and all that which has to do with the way and all that previous government came in with certain solutions to it. Now I'm talking about the present government is also coming up with another solutions to it and all clearly uh department what what what do you think will be the best solution to solve any environment how do you think it should be solved? How did we get here? That's the very first question we need to ask ourselves. It didn't happen overnight. Sure. activities. Nothing new has happened. We all know our actions and of course we know the output of what our action is going to be. We have gotten what we expect to get as a nation. Now the question is what is the way forward talking? Yes. The problem is we are pampering the perpetrators too much. Mhm. We are pampering them. You see they are ecoides in environmental toxicology toxicology ecosystem. Now because our life is dependent on the on the environment if for a few people a handful of people again and this how the country is going to go through I don't think we need to just sit and watch and be pumping the discussion on radios here and there we need to sw the beta pill we need harsh measures And the question is we as Ghanaians are we ready to fight or to deal with the Ghana say issue I don't I don't want the word fight because anytime you declare fight you have called two people the loser and the winner we are not fighting we should all deal with the situation at hand so are we ready to deal with the issue we should ask Ghanaian because different perspective Alterative livelihood for the people. You call this alternative livelihood when the future has been destroyed. There's this argument technocrats rather to really man these responsible institutions so that we will stop this political appointment on these areas. Do you think it's a is a good one? Yo, thank you very much. Ye\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ntrump dominates ruth «less\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:This is the greatest thing about Trump. He will say the thing that everybody knows is true, but everybody in the UN is afraid to say. He exposes them in a way they've never been exposed before. And he did it in 45 minutes. The UN needs to get their act together. Like, what a dump. What a clown show that gets all this money from around the world accomplishes nothing. Gets all this money from America. Accomplishes nothing. He's Donald Trump's number one enemy in Congress. Chicago Senator Dick Durban. And now Dick Durban has a new scheme, a government takeover of your credit card. Today, consumers have thousands of choices in credit cards, all with equal, strong security. But Durban's plan is less competition and less security. And that means more risk for your credit and your identity. Tell Republicans in Congress, stop Dick Durban's takeover of your credit card before it's too late. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Keep the fate. Hold the line and own the lids. It's time for our main event. Good Thursday to you. Welcome back to the Ruthless Friday program. I'm Josh Holmes along with Comfortably Smug, Michael Duncan and John Ashbrook, left to right across your radio dial. A lot going on here in the world and domestically. We're going to get to all of it. Uh, make sure to check out our video, full video that we did last night and put it up on the ICE shooting in Dallas. I think you're going to find that content pretty compelling because we go through a full history of how it is that we've gotten here and who's to blame, uh, the Democrats. Yeah. Yeah. And the and the clips up there on YouTube are fantastic. So definitely go check that out on YouTube. Go check that out. But we also have a lot of other news to cover. Yes. Uh you've all been aware of the fact that the president of the United States as well as much of the administration went up to New York for the UN United Nations big general assembly this week. And I don't know about you guys, but it seems to me like Trump going to the UN and I just like sort of thought of this on the walking into the here. It's like Jordan in the garden. Yeah, dude. That is good because it it it's like there's a hugely confrontational crowd. They know everyone hates him going in. It's the largest stage internationally. It's the only place where you know everyone is watching. And that he just deals out hard truths. And it seems like Trump gets better in that situation. Yeah. He he's like more comfortable with the uncomfortability of it than anyone I've ever seen on international stage. It's so funny you say that. I think it's also why he loves having these like open press sprays where he answers every question because I think he enjoys an adversarial environment. Like seems like you know what I mean? Like I think that's when he has his best stuff. It's like a a comedian who does crowd work and just wants to ask questions, you know, like that's when he gives you his best stuff. It it true. and he just seems to get stronger and welcome welcome the hate. Yeah. In a lot of ways. So the whole thing started off kicked off before they even walked into the joint in clip one. I'm sorry. I'm the president. I'm really sorry as the president of if you don't see it. Let me for our audio only listeners. He can't get in because the presidential motorcade is blocked. Guess what? I'm waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you. He and he's called President Trump on the phone. He's walking. Hilarious. [Laughter] We got Pepe Lew working his way through New York. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Taking pictures, walking through. So, what happened was uh he couldn't actually get to the United Nations building because the streets were shut down for Trump. Mhm. And he had to get out of his car and start walking and he calls Trump and asks Trump basically like, \"Hey, can you do something about this? I'm stuck. I can't get out.\" And he's like, \"H, you're going to have to walk.\" Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what did he think America first meant? Right. I mean, so he's on terapirma there in the United States, but as soon as you go to the UN, it's international soil. It's a hard concept for me to wrap my mind around. In the same ways that like embassies, I don't know how many of you guys know this, but embassies in in Washington DC, and there's a million of them. Every shitty country you've ever thought of has got some palatial building and but those are actually not American territory. Not my book. Right. as I agree with you. I've always They're all ours. Even the ones overseas, they're all ours. I totally agree with this, but but apparately because it's which is just wild. I mean, nothing talks about the magnanimity of the American people quite like the idea that we give some of the most important real estate in Manhattan of all places right over to the Euros and the UN and everybody else who does nothing. And you you you did some research on this. Turns out they don't pay taxes. Yeah. It doesn't appear that they pay property taxes. They don't seem to pay sales tax. They the only people who pay tax are the Americans who have regular jobs at the UN building. So if you're there cleaning up, not to mention the traffic jams, dude. Like the east side highways right where they are just making a whole town. I was in Manhattan on Tuesday and it was a parking lot. You couldn't get anywhere. Every time they do this to us. It it terrible. But all of that leads to this leadup to clip two, which you've probably seen, but I think marks an important distinction about what we're talking about. And I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter because the teleprompter is not working. I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless. And that way you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble. Think about that, dude. Like, think about like coming into this building in New York and you're Donald Trump, president of the United States and this whole place exists under your good graces. Yes. Right. And you show up and the teleprompter doesn't even work. You're the guy that they are choosing not to have the A team on. Yeah. Incredible. Right. And we're going to get into the second component of this clip 2B. All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen. But she's in great shape. We're both in good shape. We're both stood and they're all laughing. And then a teleprompter that didn't work. This is these are the two things I got from the United Nations. A bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. So, I mean, look, we we've all seen the video by now of the escalator situation, which ranges from a security concern, which is probably very real, to uh what Carolyn Lavit pointed out in that there were UN employees that were joking in a I think it was a London publication about uh how they would perhaps stop the escalators just to kind of prove that they needed more funding. for the UN. Ridiculous. US gives more money to the UN than any other country in the world. I'm so done with them. I'm so done with them. Like it is an absolute security risk. Uh especially for President Trump who has had nu I mean I think just the day that happened, one of his assassins was found guilty and tried to stick a pen in their own neck. Like uh they need to get their act together. They need to get their act together. President Trump needs to at all times be extremely safe and secure with a full appreciation, understanding of the number of times there have been attempts on his life. Number two, the UN needs to get their act together. Like what a dump. What a clown show that gets all this money from around the world accomplishes nothing. Gets all this money from America. Accomplishes nothing. I totally agree. Yeah. I mean, put Donald Trump's record of peace up against the UN. Yep. You know what I mean? Well, and he proceeded against rightfully did proceeded to go through that, right? And so he just makes a scathing case to the UN of like, you guys don't do [ __ ] First of all, your building sucks. My experience today has been terrible. Second of all, I'm the one that's doing the peacekeeping around here. What are you people up to? I've seven different occasions solved global conflicts on my own and I didn't even get so much as a call from you people. I love this about Trump. Yes. It's like for the most part every American president at some level has gone into that venue and had a point that they wanted people to follow, but it's like basically one point that is a a a major priority internationally that he's trying to drive the UN towards and then they make nice and they talk about common goals and they do whatever. Not Trump. Trump walks into that thing and he's like, I've got a lot to say here. I It's a listing of grievances to start with. Second of all, I got a lot of things that you guys are doing shitty that I think I'm going to tell you about and make you super uncomfortable because nobody else in this room or this shitty compilation of United Nations are going to discuss if I don't. And you all recall the first time around when he went in in 2017. Oh, he's so confrontational. Oh, what is he doing? Oh my gosh, we're going to get lose so much respect in the world. And what he was talking about is ponying up for their mutual security. Mhm. And they all laughed him out of the room and they're like, \"Oh god, he's just an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about.\" And 5 years later, they're all racing to double the commitment that he asked him to make because they knew he was right. And then the second thing that he talked about, does it make a lot of sense that you people are buying energy from somebody that you formed an entire alliance? Yeah. Yeah, the whole NATO try to prevent, you know, like you got an entire security thing t\r\n",

You know, he was supposed to be here this morning. He explained that in fact he couldn't get home yesterday or something like that um due to the traffic. He traveled and so long story and um he to be fair to him he volunteered to do this uh program by Zoom. But I I said that look the kind of discussion I want to have with him. It's such that I'd like us to to be close by. Um I I don't know if you've noticed if you try to do interviews by Zoom or by telephone usually it will become an interview but sometimes what you want to have is a discussion and there's something about you being with the person you know close by and so on and so forth. I opted to to let it go to let it let it go and we'll choose a more suitable day next time. I'm so sorry about that. But um these floods will go with all kinds of casualties. Um all kind attached to them. Do do you do are my sentiments right or wrong? You didn't because of No, because of the interview. Yeah. Why why I'd rather have him live in the studio instead of having him by Zoom? Yes, because um there are other factors that um that can affect Zoom at any point in time. It's it's quite unpredictable. Very very unpredictable. Then you have interruptions and it's it's it's quite a a serious um matter. Um I was I was in the forefront of hoping that we'd have um an airline um that that would play very prominent role on the international front and I also am one of those who believe that government would have nothing entirely to do with a national airline that we could I believe I'm one of those who believe that we could have a national aine without it being owned by the government and you can see the various attempts Um I remember the days of Nigeria Airways. Um maybe some of us also what we found on ground. Um Niger ways every top gun could even I remember back in the day too we had friends in the military who could open up their ticket for you and you go on the plane. Wow. Yes. I was tell just like that. Yes. Now ah in the military for example in the military in the military's office if you want to go somewhere he could write that a ticket he had the tickets he had blank tickets oh at least for local flights I don't know what it is about and yes journalist too back in the day would just when you couldn't there were no phone calls but he walk up to the office go to kon go there so and I and I also know that government cured. Oh, the military incured a lot of deaths. Nigeria Airways, we'll leave the story for Nigeria Airways. We'll never talk about it again because it will open up old wounds. So, had been in the forefront and I must give him at the credit for having set up air piece. Um, but I believe that the airline should outgrow him. That that is where I'm gravitating to. I I believe that in the national spirit he should make sure that the airline outgrows him meaning that he doesn't solely own the airline as it were per se. Um he he has done well relatively they have a lot of problems I was going to highlight with um day and find out from a professional standpoint apart from lateness and so on and so forth. operationally generally I believe um very strongly that you need to repackage a new management for that airline possibly without the getting involved. Those are one of the things I wanted to start out on. Repackage the airline putting putting proper independent management independent of the MD independent of all influences. Um because again when things happen um the airline has always given an impression that they take these things personal like when they couldn't get a slot in uh in He made it all sound personal is because of this is because of that and anytime they have uh there's an issue with the regulator is always appears as if the regulator has matter fact there was a time it was also the tribal element also who you know came into this. So these were some of the things I was going to take up with um but I I I think that all of us need to gather together and make sure that that airline um succeeds um the benefits are many. Look at now the new the new arrangement signed by the government um which the president was able to sign when he went to Brazil. It has an air packact between Nigeria and Brazil. And from the way I look at it, it looks as if airpace will have a monopoly of that route because my friends in Brazil have told me that it's not likely their own airline for now is going to be able to so because when I asked my friend, my friend invited me to come over to present and said ear you know so I mean it's good the Nigerian flag also there's a story here on a vacation that they're going to start flying not air piso but Tanzanian airliner. Well, I don't know how many people go to. Have you ever been to Tanzania before? No, I would love to. The funny thing is that every time I hear Tanzania, I remember Tangayika which was the original name. Tangika. Tangika. Yes. which was the name that I that we had when and I remember Juler their leader who after being president I think it was even the governor that built the only bungalow he had after fighting for independence being president and so on and so forth they don't cut them like that um they don't cut them like that anymore so what what we're going to do is um Um, I mean, there are probably one or two stories that came up this morning that we didn't have time to look at. I'm going to look at that. Then, of course, we can open up our lines and you might want to um to contribute. The first story that caught my mind this morning that we didn't have time to look at is a story that is credited to First Bank. And the story said that First Bank is to unveil a disability friendly banking service. And that struck me. Let me read the story. It says that in a move to improve accessibility, First Bank of Nigeria has announced roll out of specialized banking services for customers with visual and physical disabilities. This is quite impressive. The initiative according to the bank underscores his commitment. Okay. All the corporate whatever is said there. Patrick Akideno the chief risk and chairman of the first bank sub committee said the program is designed to ensure that all customers regardless of ability can independently and securely access services. Okay. So what will it be? Let me see. The phase the phase rollout will extend across all first bank subsidiaries and locations introducing several innovations. What are these innovations? These include transaction documents in braille. Okay. Audio, large print and digital formats, enhanced ATM with high contrast screens and voice prompt commands and debit cards featuring tactile motives and braille inscriptions. Yeah, it's very good. I I saw this. In fact, I saw this story yesterday. We miss it. We miss it today. And now I'm glad I have the opportunity. Let me repeat again. First bank is targeting so that you can do your transaction documents are in braille. Uh um this braille audio large print and digital formats enhanced ATMs with high contrast screens and voice prompt commands and debit cards featuring tactile motives and braid inscriptions. Now to further security, the bank would employ enhanced soft spins and tokens. Soft pins and tokens while product brochures will be made available to accessible formats to improve engagement. Um then of course the PR part of it in align with CBN's financial inclusion strategy uh blah blah blah blah blah to and as well as United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which advocate equal access to financial services. I I wonder what it's like now. um sheriff I wonder if there's any bank or top institution for that matter that has any provisions for people with challenges even even in as much as the access itself sometimes look there's one of the big banks there on what's this what's this street called I just said even I I find it difficult to climb the staircase to get up to the bank it's very steep very very stiff. I with my legs still walking. Sometimes I find it your leg works. It works. Very how many times. Okay. But I do I find it very stiff. So I can imagine anybody with a disability is not going to go into that. Yeah. Now, so I I'd like to challenge the banks to contact us and let us know which of their branches are disability friendly. Very good. Which of their This is a challenge to all the banks, Zenith, Access, GTB, all the big boys. Which of your branches can we tell our customers are are accessible for people with physical challenges? Because see part of the problem we have is that let's call a speed a spade and the attitude has to change once you are physically challenged h in this country you are bound to defeat you have to get everything done by yourself but I remember oh good old Kyogi and a few others I've remember them seen them turning up at at the studio now and I'm asking how how did you get here? M Kadi used to come here by himself. Yes. Yeah. There's a another younger lawyer. He used to work with my late brother. Yeah. I think he was here. Yeah. The day he turned up, I was stunned. And so he said um I said, \"So where are you going from here?\" He said he was going to was it Ketu? I I'm not going to go down. He said he knows that he'll get down at stadium and find his way to Ketu. Oh, but I know a lot of these are uh they're like personal um whatever. It's important that we we we tend to realize that the same thing for sorry boss the same thing for our public transport and that is even worse. That's even worse. Um so we must we must come to the realization that if you see um uh London transport for example you're disabled you're on a wheelchair if you see the problem the driver goes through to make sure that you bought that vehicle he would tilt the he will come down he will tilt the bus then he has he has a slide and he will physically himself unless of course you are being accompanied he will push your your router onto the ball. He's going to delay that bus by two, three minutes, but so be it. But so be it. Um I like that. Yes, but so so be it. And I and I usually tell people that and of course we call it spade is paid. Some people scorn at physically disabled people forgetting that the only day you are free from physical disability is the day you die. Is the day you die and a fellow had had an inscription that dead body accident. So is the day you die that you can say you're free. Your life can turn around immediately. We should always have that at the back of our minds. I agree. anytime something happens to another person or I say the first thing I ask I I usually ask myself or say to myself that it could jolly well be me and once we once we have that attitude um so I I I'm glad what first bank has done um this is an open invitation to uh we will look for him but in case anybody Mr. Patrick Aki Akideno he's the chair risk officer whatever it's an open invitation for him we like him to come to the studio to explain to us how exactly this new arrangement is going to work uh if there are other banks that are doing it we would like to know but if there are no other banks doing it we like to thank first bank for um taking the initiative to make life more pleasurable for disabled um people. There's also another related story here which we couldn't take this morning. What's the time, Sherry? Yes, we're 19. Okay. And it has to do with the National Association of Resident Doctors again and again and again and again. They are bringing out suggestions as to what we can do to to to to stop the drift of our medical personnel, not just doctors. Not just doctors. And we'd like to beg the politicians, you found a problem with the judiciary, you handled it right. Do the same likewise for for for medicine because it it affects everybody. It affects everybody. How can you you're ready to treat judges like whatever and you're not going to do the same for doctors, right? I think same for lecturers, same for same lecturers. The doctors say migration of medical personnel is putting pressure on the health care system. If you go to the hospitals these days, even the private ones, sheriff, even the p private ones for the rich and everything, if you go, the cues are so long. My Jack was telling me the other day that he went to a government hospital in the Kenya. I like my you know, he's quite he's a patriotic Nigerian. He likes likes to do things prim and proper. Money, uncle. Okay. Yeah, he's uncle to me. He's au to me. He's a small boy. A small boy. So when he said morning uncle, I was wondering who I kept looking. So and he was telling me that what for checkup just to take up to see his doctor. He went to this particular hospital. He got there at 7:00. He had a novel in hand. He saw his doctor at 5. 5:00 p.m. Yes. and and and and I was looking at his mood when he was talking because the first thing I wanted to ask him is ah the same Nigerian thing. Do you know somebody you can see through the back end and so on? But we can't continue to run AC. And by the way, my doctor in the UK is my personal friend. We went to went to university together. I can't jump the to see him in his own hospital. I can't I can't jump. I can't jump the queue to see him. I have to get an appointment like everybody. Because if I did that and isn't is not hospital the patients have the right to complain and if care is not taken is is practice could be shut down. So I was tempted to ask my da my wants to be like every other person. So I said fine. So he he left. He said he got there at seven novel in hand or book in hand. I don't know whether it was no he didn't see the doctor until 5. Wow. But it's not even any better in the private hospitals. Some of the most expensive hospitals people attend to even in VR here. Some of I don't want to mention the name of the clinics. I've known people who have spent hours trying to see a doctor specialist. So that tells you that immediately tells you that there is a mass shortage. As for nurses is even worse worse because when my late brother was on admission in Luth I knew for sure I was told quite well that there is a shortage of nurses and we we can't sit back and do nothing about it and the people must must take their their lives their faith in their hands and force these politicians because they are well well taken care of though sometimes God gets to the detail. There was a a big man who who who had an accident here. I always like to tell the story. It's a good example. Top gone military officer in those days. He had an accident and they quickly rushed him onto the air ambulance. They were able to rustle an ambulance. He died me there before the thing plane level. And my good friend, the late Dr. Koop, not you know his elder brother, late Dr. who is a head specialist. He he said when a thing like that like speaking out of his voice, God bless his soul. I miss him so much. When an accident like that happens, the treatment start from where the man is. You don't even touch him. You don't even carry him. If you like, let it happen in the in the boot of Ubul or whatever, you have to stabilize him until the doctor comes. And then guess what? the people, the os who at the other end waiting for them. Oh, time. Yes. Oh, this is just getting sweet. I'll take a short break and then we'll be right back. [Music] More news and information coming up. We'll be back in a moment.

While unpacking, she pulled out John Ben's 3in-1 chocolate and started hyping it. Creamy, tasty, and more. I just smelled and nodded. taking her seriously. Fast forward 2 weeks, I'm calling her asking where she bought it because I need more for my family. Once you've had a taste of instant goodness, the original going back. John Vent 3in1 chocolate. Enjoy instant goodness. This is where the headlines meet the hot takes. All the feelings of the people knowing that Fra is set to return as governor of River State. We have crisis before, we have actions during, and definitely there will be some actions after. regulation of food prices. I think that some miracle is supposed to happen and our magician is the president. The farmers that you are giving directive they say you want to crash the food price that not only farmer you know some of these monies that we've continuously been taxed take seriously or they were just brought in by devil to come and make us suffer. State government has lamented that youth take weapons and food to bandits. Nigeria's investors who are in Midas are complaining you are asking investors who are not in Nigeria to come and invest. Are you kidding me? Stay with us on 99.3 Nigeria info. Let's talk. You're listening to Jimmy right here on 99.3 Nigeria. Nigeria info. Hey. [Music] Okay. So, you're welcome back to the Daily Digest. One more time, I apologize uh because of the circumstances of Lumin was not here. We'll do it again next week. Um but I was then before we went on break, I was talking about um health and what was it I was talking about? Do you remember? I think I've forgotten. So, all kinds of have gone. Gone. Okay. But I I I think essentially essentially what what we're saying is that we'd like you know the government to pay premium on health services and um look at what the enemy are saying here on its part. The Nigerian medical association at land key measures government must adopt to stem the exodus of doctors. There are four major things government can do to stop the jawa syndrome. One of course is um first improve remuneration towards consolid I don't know what it is but please pay doctors well pay them as well as you pay magistrates and judges they are equally important if not more important second provide better welfare package when I was growing up I I I will always repeat the country that I grew up in that make me so passionate about this country if you are a young doctor if you if you you were doing Houseman, you'd live on the premises of Luth or General Hospital. Okay? They had like a a mini like some kind of mini flat for house doctors. And you were given a car loan when you were doing your house. So when it's time for youth call, they'll most likely come with come with a brand new car. That was why as a young man, I I totally hated if I could inject them with something. I hated doctors and pilots. I hope my friend Hus is not listening to because these were the people who are settled by society far ahead of the rest of us. It's just a joke really. But you see so I I remember I remember that Dr. I don't know where is now. We used to take his master 9 through9. Imagine he got it that car loan brand new to we were the ones who took up that were the ones who took off the he was a red red master Mazda 929 with with cream upholstery. Oh sh you don't know what you've been missing. I don't know. That's the way doctors were treated. You would want to be a doctor. You would want to be a doctor because doctors are okay. So I'd like to be corrected. I wish I could get one of them. I think they were put on level nine, government level nine when you're doing your house man because you would have done five but even pharmacy students did the same thing. So the issue of jackpower was at the better maybe those who wanted to help their academics but what we have now is a complete disaster. It's a complete disaster. So uh they they also talk about um a professional allowances and implementation of non- taxable call duty. The other day we heard of a doctor who had worked for 72 hours and collapsed and died. Oh yes. Yes. Um provide better welfare packages including housing loans spread over 10 to 15 years and car loans over 5 years. Third, invest in the training and retraining of doctors locally locally and abroad. Okay. Fourth, improve infrastructure and creative. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to drag Dr. down here next week. Okay. From the old school uh medical school so that he can learn the voice and you know um actually give us what it was like when he started out as a is a big time doctor. He had his own clinic, but he can say how how it was when he when he started out and he he said association of medical laboratory science um scientists said that Nigeria is bleeding from the health workforce exodus even the nurses you discover that a lot of those who are even those who didn't bother to do nursing initially now go quickly go and do nursing two three years um I know somebody who was with with me um a young lady then uh in the vanguard when I was in the vanguard I was a young man too all running around the place today she's one of the she's even retired now she's one of the big psych psychiatrist nurses baby as part of her retirement package new not we I like to bring things down so that you can get a feel. It's not to to see them in abstract, better this, better that. It's for you to get a feel of what it used to be in the past. And uh so that okay, let's open up our lines in case you have something to say um about all the things I've said today. 0201 2770993 and 0201-465719. Please remember if anybody can help, we will try to get in touch with the first bank. We'd like them to come and explain in detail what it is that they have for um people with disabilities. Good morning. Hello. Ah Kelvin now agrector none of them get treated here h even it has gone that bad that local government chairman now go abroad for medical treatment yes I don't want to mention local government that are going abroad now for treatment with state money before the use no I don't I don't vex I just said it. So as long as these politicians are not treated here and their families are not treated yet like your words, let me borrow your words, they will abandon all of us to the Philistines. Yes. It's a shame that in this same country the royal family was coming here for medical treatment. It has been said several times on this platform how the royal family were were coming the Saudi royal family. Yes. 62 and all of a sudden it is reversed the case. I was reading the report of the medical of J in 2003 alone when Dr. Chris was telling us that we have more doctors that have almost 2,000 doctors left Nigeria in Japan. Okay. Dr. They were telling us h we don't have shortage of doctors everybody everything is well this in 2024 last year it has to almost 4,000 doctors that have left it's not my record it's not my report they should go and check the medical house so where do we go from here I know what I have faced in the past two three weeks and it's not a public hospital yes eventually we lost my mother-in-law very sorry about that we in we in a mess We don't know where we are headed. Except those that want to see go and get the original eye like say don't use a eye. If you use everything get that where it's not a good place. Thank you. Okay. Talking about eye doesn't mean that you should remove your eye and put another eye. No, don't take it literally. He's referring to fell song called Big Blind Country which I think is on YouTube. Ah, by the way, tomorrow my my my son is my borrowed stolen son Madakuti. He's going to be 30. So, in case I forget, somebody should remind me to wish him a happy birthday. Madi will be 30 tomorrow and he's he's done very very well for himself. I'm so proud of him. I've told Fei that he should be very careful if I have enough money to go and do some DNA cleaners. But uh M in case I forget tomorrow, tomorrow is M's birthday. It's going to be 30 and I think there will be JJ Mus and Baby Mus, but I don't know where. Well, I'll look for it. I'll look for it because I must eat the rice of my son. Oh yeah, let's go again. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. This is Kenny, Uncle Jimmy. Hey, Kenny. Hannah, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Hi, Sheriff. No, Uncle Jimmy. Know somebody that is currently under house manship? Yes. and he's almost wrapping up next month. You know, he hasn't got paid one month salary from a military hospital. What I'm telling you, the only beauty about this is that yes, they give them nice quarters, you know, every doctor to their own suite, you know, their mini kitchen with a brand new stove and all that, but they haven't been paid and they're almost wrapping up. So, that's why you have that right there. The only other thing I would say that they do in quote well you know in inverted common is that doctors get about 150k for NYC and that was at the time when regulars you know people were getting like 33k I don't know if it's been reversed upwards or not but yeah they have a long way to go in order to retain our doctors I'm all for doctors and medical people jacking they have no I mean now for goodness sake how many years you've worked here and you know you study here and then you get paid peanuts. No, now good job, Uncle Jimmy. I appreciate your show. All right. Um, yes. Um, I don't know how much they pay them my youth service now, but there's a need to review. You see what what I find objectionable. Let me be very very is why we keep making this noise over and over again. We made the noise, a little noise for the judges. It was done. We didn't need to make noise for the public office as they then grab everything by themselves, bought themselves, 160 million naira car and all kinds of things. But the doctors who would treat us the masses there's an element of wickedness in all this. I cannot be convinced otherwise. There's an element of nonalance and what might translate to outright wickedness in all this not wanting to make help of Yeah. You want to say something? I I just have a message. Okay. Yes. Uh this is from He says, \"My name is Dr. Alu. I work in t...",

The people's breakfast. Your morning. Your voice. Your journey. Good morning. Good morning, my neighbor. Welcome to the home of hard truths and bold insights. Radio Generation. 601 and 22 seconds. It is. This is Radio Generation. My name is Moana and uh you are tuned in to 88.8 FM in Nairobi and 90.7 in Mombasa. A very good morning to you. You can let us know where you're listening from. By the way, you can find us on our socials that is at radioenk across all of them and on YouTube at radiogeneration Kenya saw. My name is Malami and seated across me is none other than CT muga. Mr. Muga, a very good morning to you. Morning you Paul. How are you? Minos salamana. Yes. Yeah. Um I'm feeling great this morning. Had a hot cup of coffee before I got to the office. So I'm feeling energized and rejuvenated and um you know I have that jolt of energy inside me. Good for you. Yeah. Coffee. Coffee. Yes. All right. Do you take anything other than coffee? Tea. What I drink in abundance is actually water. Mhm. Yes. I mean, water is normal. That's why I'm not asking because it isn't normal. Very many people who drink probably just one glass a day. I drink a heck of a lot of water. I am that one glass a day person. Yes. That's what I'm saying. When I say I drink water, I don't mean I sip one glass a day. Yeah. I drink something like 3 or 4 liters a day. Wait, what? I drink something like 3 or 4 liters of water a day. For why? For why? Because it is healthy. 3 to four liters a day. Not in one sitting. Yeah. Of I mean I know it's not like that you'll take 1, two, 3. It's not like that. It's not like that. But you're regularly taking water. I am regularly taking water. If I go somewhere and I'm sitting and people having a drink, I ask for water and I ask for a liter which I sip quietly. Sometimes I usually forget to take water like literally. It's all right. Yeah, you will. It's not all right. I I need to create a habit. Well, you haven't created a habit. I'm saying it's all right because you haven't seen the need. The day you see the need, yeah, you'll create the habit. But so far, you haven't. So, it is all right that you haven't. On the day you create the habit, it'll also be all right. There's a time uh like 3 or 4 years back I literally had to put an alarm to remind me to take water. You are a consumer of our alcoholic beverages. You should drink a lot of water, sir. But you see what I'm talking about. Dehydrates you. I know. I know what I'm what I'm trying to say is that I take I I literally some like then I I I jump on a glass or two then I chill again and then I forget until the next day. Don't worry the importance of water will hit you on these days and when it does you will not need a reminder. Why does that sound like a like a threat? Like I am actually merely stating a fact. the importance of it, right, will hit you. When it does, you will not need a reminder. Okay. All right. But just if it's any consolation, you're not alone. Mhm. [Music] water. Yes. So you have to replenish it. Yes. Today is the 25th day of 202 um 5 that is September and um the United Nations is celebrating World Maritime Day. World Maritime Day. And uh the theme for this particular day is our ocean, our obligation, our opportunity. Several initiatives will take place today to commemorate the day including and not limited to lighting up landmarks. So every um international maritime authority um headquarter will be bathed in blue light in the evening of the day that is today to promote this year's theme. And of course IMO invites member states, intergovernmental organizations in cooperation with IMO and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with IMO to light up landmarks. So, in case today you're driving somewhere or you're walking somewhere in the evening and then you see it's been lit blue, chances are it's because they are um celebrating World Maritime Day. A day I didn't even think existed. But yo, the United Nations has got everything for everything. A day for everything rather. But it's important because um our oceans are very very critical and important. They're actually very critical to our very existence. Without them, chances are we wouldn't be here. So big shout out to our ocean. If at all it will receive that shout out. Oh yes. [Applause] [Music] Yes. The the proverb I found particularly interesting to the point of being hilarious. The bald woman boasts of her sister's hair. The bald woman. Bald. Bald. Bald. Bald. It's bald. Okay. Woman boasts of her sister's hair. Mhm. Right. The bald woman boasts of her sister's hair. But then the other communities on this planet and on this in this country where somebody will boast of his relatives achievement. Yes. [Music] Mhm. [Music] And in this case, [Music] that's interesting. But I wouldn't expect people in ladies in Tunisia specifically to be bald. No, no, no. That's the beauty of a proverb. What do you think they're trying to say? To be honest, I I don't know. Are they um you know, are they are they celebrating the beauty of their sisters or or is it like what what what is the deeper meaning? I like the way you respond to questions. I ask you what you think the deeper meaning is and then I say I don't know. I said what what is meaning? No, you what do you think? I didn't say give me the exact meaning of it because an an exact meaning doesn't exist. What do you think? Think please. Okay, let me think. I think it means to be honest I can't think. Maybe it's the coffee. Did you hear the Carthaginians? No. You never studied history? No. Ancient Carthage? Carthage I know I know about. vers. Now that my friend is Tunisia. Uh-huh. Okay. It's rich in history. It was part of the Roman Empire. The Romans claimed as an empire at some point. I am actually separating the time of the Roman rule over it. Okay. With its existence even prior to that. It was a civilization that existed on its own. All right. S. And in a previous time before the occupation of the Romans, they are the ones who had occupied some of those countries around the Mediterranean. Okay. All right. And one sees remnants of their culture in some of those areas. What is it that makes other people take pride in someone else's? It meaning I may not have done well for myself, but my friend, don't treat me as someone who's insignificant. My own blood sister, my own blood brother is a significant person. and I come from that family. So I am not a nobody. Okay. Yes. That's profound. Yes. Yeah. Let me use a phrase that I hear using. Geniuses. [Music] All right. So, a bold woman takes pride in her sister's hair. Yes. Interesting. Thank you for that one, Mr. CT. We truly appreciate it. And it's time for us to jump on to something called our website. Now, in case you're joining us for the first time, first of all, a very much welcome to you. We have a website that is rk.co.ke where not only do you get to see us live, you also get to listen to us live. And most importantly, you'll get to see some of the stories that have actually you get to see all the stories that have been making headlines in the last couple of hours. And these are stories of significance. Whether it's in news, sports, politics, whether it's in business, technology, entertainment, education, you name it, you'll find it on rg.co.ke. [Music] For instance, the first story that we're going to interact with is and they keep on updating every few minutes. So don't think that the one I'm reading right now depart in the next two minutes. So for instance, R demands Gaza ceasefire. It does. Yeah. Yeah. hostage release and strong Haiti support. So, yeah, that is United Nations General Assembly abbreviated. Okay. around the world like President William R has urged the international community to push for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the unconditional release of hostages saying that the protection of civilians and adherence to humanitarian law must never be selective. Addressing the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, R said that the suffering of innocent people in conflict zones including Gaza and Sudan cannot be ignored. He resisted that a credible political process is the only path to lasting peace. Oh, he insisted, not resisted, he insisted that a credible political process is the only path to lasting peace. So our president said what he said and yeah so [Music] well he's joining very many voices. Yes of course remember very members of the European Union have stated categorically that they recognize the state of Palestine. Oh yes um France did that just a day or two ago. The United Kingdom did the same and many other countries. Oh yes. M so what does that mean though for what does that mean for what does that mean for for Israel and specifically to to you know talking about uh their prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the state of Israel did not exist in 1944 as it's currently constituted that land mass was called Palestine all right so we know how the history goes we know what happened and we keep talking about 1947 the 94 declaration blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. What I have found particularly interesting is how Britain Yeah. and their friends the uh um the French Yes. These are people who are in Europe. They come to what they now they they call the Middle East and they they decide they decide that uh these people who are called Palestinians can just be moved so that uh somebody uh else can come and occupy the land. Mhm. Okay. Yes. What they forget is that this problem did not begin in the Balffor declaration of 1917. This began in 1916. Yeah. The Sykes Picot agreement signed by France and Britain to carve out land previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Okay. That's how it started. Mhm. Then the Balffor Declaration now cemented this. The idea was you cover a piece of a piece. But that is not what has happened over time. Over time, all that they've done, yes, is just keep pushing for more land and pushing and creating settlers, pushing and creating settlers. That's actually what they've done. Meaning, you set about removing people from land which was theirs. You brought in other people. Mhm. These fellows didn't seem to have a problem sharing this land with these people. But then the owners of the land are now the ones who own the smallest port of the land which was previously theirs. Yeah. So, so what then would be the solution? city. The discussion about um two states, Palestine existing as a state and Israel existing, if you look at the narratives that um have been predominant in this discussion is a refusal by successive governments in Israel to actually accept that idea, the two-state solution. And the one time you had a prime minister who actually sought to have this done, that fellow got himself assassinated for his efforts. Mhm. Okay. So there are people who are determined. But for such a thing to actually happen, for such a thing to take root, there must be an arching narrative. A narrative that or narratives that propel people to believe that what they're doing is justified. Mhm. Okay. I'm reminded of a story. I visited the land of Israel with u the church that I go to. Okay. And one of the things that struck me, our tour guide was an Israeli gentleman. Our driver Yes. was an Arab Palestinian. What do you call a Palestinian? An Arab. And there are comments that our tour guide kept making until I actually had to ask him Yeah. quietly. He'd pass some buildings and he'd say, \"You know, these buildings which seem half finished, they belong to the Arabs.\" I said, \"How do you know?\" Said, \"Yeah, but Arabs never finished their buildings.\" I said, \"Well, how?\" Said, \"Well, according to our laws, if the exterior of the building is not completed according to the required standards, then you don't pay tax.\" So, they like avoiding tax. So, I I kept quiet and asked, \"But our driver is Arab. You know, you what you're saying is a little derogatory, aren't you?\" Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. that these people again this is what he said he's a young man these people are like that I we were a busload of people I pulled him aside later and told him chief the bus driver uncomfortable cuz I was watching him you are speaking disrespectfully to this person yes it never occurred to me to recall this until I started seeing what was happening in recent time I realized there has to be a dominant narrative that people have and it's the kind of narrative that led to the genocide in Rwanda. It is the kind of narrative that was there when we talk about the Holocaust. There are always narratives. One of them is that these people are not human beings like us. They're inferior. Thank you. It's the same narrative that propelled apatide. Okay. Same narrative. So you are more more or less justified the narrative of civilizing the native the missionaries who first came. It's a narrative. M there must be a narrative that drives certain people in the population of Israel cuz it's not all of them. Yeah. Those who are I'm told are referred to as a Zionist to be able to do what they do and because they believe they actually believe they've gone to a point where they've accepted and they believe that that is so. Okay. So when they do it it's like they're doing it from a righteous position. And yet if you look at it Yes. You've dehumanized other human beings like yourself. You've considered them to be subhuman but more importantly you've considered that you are right and then that right of yours cannot be questioned and you know it's actually a very crazy for me I actually call it crazy because that that is what it is. I don't even write here back at home about certain communities but I don't think it has ever gotten to this level. Actually you've stated a fundamental point Paul that is why we must not I remember once in a talk show there was an issue that had arisen at the coast and we had a member of parliament from another region of the country it was a mai issue and the person then commented and said but you know these people at the coast are very lazy I said what it's a narrative that some people hold meaning you are justified Yeah. In plundering what is theirs because they are lazy. These are a people who've been living and they have a civilization that has thrived for a very long time and somehow they lazy. We all have those narratives and that's what we must guard against because it then enables you. We saw it rearing its head when we had our problems in 2008. Why? You first of all begin by profiling that person. M then you dehumanize them by creating a narrative that names them as subhuman. You have you've begun. So the harm that is being done to these people is not being done to a human being. Yeah. We must really guard against these narratives. They are dangerous. They are extremely dangerous. Different with someone on policy, differ with someone on opinion. differ with someone on matters of of of ideology, but the moment you profile, you are on a slippery slope. I agree. CS Mcommen warns against desecration of the Kenyan flag. Uhhuh. Uh, this one I'm sure you've seen a couple of videos going around there. Interior National Administration cabinet secretary Kipumen has warned that anyone found desecrating Kenya's national flag or symbols will face legal consequences. He stressed that the law is clear on the matter and offenders will not be spared. Speaking during the 45th Jala Salama security forum in Wajia County on Wednesday, Murin condemned a recent incident at Na National Stadium where a group of fans was filmed stomping and kicking the Kenyan flag during a cuff champions uh league match. you know, um I've I've actually seen many other videos um insulting Kenya, the Kenyan flag, and then insulting Kenyans in general, saying that, \"Oh, you know, you're just keyboard warriors.\" And I'm I'm just paraphrasing here, but you're just keyboard warriors. All you do is you know how to complain behind the desk, but you can never do anything. And this person was saying that I will even come to the stadium and I will do this and that and I will even burn that flag. And I was like, \"Yeah, but you know, you know, you know, [Music] no there are things you do not give credit by responding to. You know why?\" Yeah. What exactly does such a person hope to achieve by that ranting? [Music] So I narrow it down to one simple perspective. You must distinguish between your problem and someone else's. [Music] Yes. Hey how do we have that problem? Yeah. We are keyboard warers. Yes we are. Yeah. We complain. Yes we do. And and yes exactly by us doing those things. Okay, we've heard you. So, so exactly where's the problem exactly? Yeah. Yes. I mean, uh, and like you said, don't qualify that thing by even responding to it. Let it be. If that's how you think, then we've understood how you think and we leave it at that. Lecturers push for jail of cabinet secretaries as strike criminals universities. And I'm laughing this about this because um how realistic is this? It absolutely it can't even take off. So lecturers are pushing for jail of cabinet secretaries as strike cripples universities. Again story that has been published about an hour ago. Learning in public in universities has ground to a halt for the seventh day as lecturers press on with their strike. Now escalating the standoff into the courts by seeking the imprisonment of three cabinet secretaries over a failure to honor salary agreements worth billions. Now Yasu that is the university's academic staff union through lawyer Titus Co has filed a contempt case targeting education cabinet secretary Julius Okamba, Treasury CS John and Labour CS Alfred Muta. Also cited in the case are Attorney General Dorcas Odor, Salaries and Remuneration Commission, uh, Secretary Margaret Joker, Interpublic Universities Council's Consultative Forum, uh, Chairperson Professor Fred Simu Barasa and Secretary Professor Daniel Mugendi. Professor Daniel Mugendi used to be at KU at one point and he was the deputy vice chancellor in charge of uh, oh my goodness, why am I forgetting? But yeah, I remember he was the DVC when I was in campus back back in the day. Doc, Professor Mugendi was a very cool guy. Um, and I also know Professor Simasa Fredasa [Music] yesterday when we were Who are we talking to? I think we were talking to Yeah. Dr. Pet. One thing that Dr. Peter Bay pointed out is the fact that in the government that he served at the time that he served it, things were not moving because key decisions were not with the the principles or the secretaries or the CSS and everyone else uh that was involved in ministries and that they had to uh you know confirm their orders or even confirm their activities and duties with state house. So I think we might be wasting our energy on saying that we need to um arrest or jail the CSS Julius Aamba, John Baddy, Alfred Muta and all these other people that have been mentioned in this because come for lack of a better word these people are just flower girls in the office surely. What are we saying? You know the that's a narrative isn't it? Yeah of course we are just going with what Dr. Peter and while he was there I always have um a query whenever I hear these things and you heard me express it yesterday. Uhhuh. What stops you from raising an issue when you actually there while you're in the government? Yes. Well, for example, he said he was being frustrated because every time he wants to um um action anything, he would be told, \"Go, I'mma have you confirmed with so and so?\" And he was like, \"Why do I need to confirm with so and so? my work is is cut out. My job description is very clear. Why? Why do I need to? And he was saying that he kept on getting calls from state house and people close to the president. And he was like, \"Guys, what are we doing?\" Did he not understand the system he was in? Let me let me explain something here. Mhm. This is akin to what we hear of well this narrative that is stated that parliament has been captured. Yes. That that in my opinion is absolutely bloody ash. It's not true. Parliament being captured. It's not true. Okay. Parliament parliamentarians have surrendered the birthight we gave them to represent us with. They are the ones who have surrendered it. The capture was not forcible. No. No. They gave it. They willingly abandoned the the independence. They had the freedom that we had given them. They abandoned it. the pieces of silver that are involved we don't know but they abandoned it. So this idea of capture because that narrative then blames the executive. There is no executive on this planet that does not try to influence parliament. None. You see what you've said there is no executive that doesn't attempt or try yes to influence their parliament. None. But the question is how do they do it? And also the parliaments that have been you know attempted do they fold? Do they agree? Do they sell that birthright? You see the beauty is that we had parliament where the opposition was in essence within the same party cuz we had a one party state and there were very dire consequences. But with the one party state there were people who would oppose the government. They have been elected on that party ticket and they're opposing it. Yeah. Just think about that extremity. Mhm. With the advent of multipartism, it became clearer. People got detained. The laws allowed for detention. People got jailed because they expressed contrary opinions. Okay. Mhm. It was a one party state. Okay. Mhm. So now multipartism has grown legs. It's it's it's it's an adolesccent. It has grown legs. Yes. It can actually walk. It's now running. Yes. And then someone wants to tell you, \"Oh, we've been captured.\" No, no, no. You haven't been captured. You have betrayed the people who actually gave you their power to represent them with you have now given that power to somebody else against the wishes of the people who gave it to you. That is the reality. Now I want to ask a question because okay parliament we have agreed them. They sold their birthight. It's unfortunate. However, I am inclined to agree with Dr. Ambai here. Why? Because let's look at some of the issues the government has been facing. Um the president rather has been facing all these committees that he's been coming up with. Then all these issues with the judiciary whereby the judiciary says one thing president decides you know he can do something different about it. then um committees here or commissions here that have been formed to do do what and then people go to court and then the court blocks that particular um committee or commission yet the government has got people who I am assuming are are equally learned as the judges who make these decisions in court don't they advise the president tell the president look there's no way you'll form a committee on check in ABCD because eu it's not constitutional we have doras the ag and many other people Chumba is is as a as a as a as a lawyer and many other people professor Kur Kind Kind sorry um and who else um professor these are learned individuals people who've attained you know whatever the highest levels of law degrees so I'll tell you this either they also don't understand the law or something is wrong from what I have observed over time just my own observation the the data gathering method I use was observation is that the presidency is usually not as simple as we think it is we have this idea of what it is and then there's what it is a president relies on other people for that presidency to stay put this reliance is where the problem comes in because these people act as a filter in many ways. The president can't know everything even if they told there are people who will be running interference with the information they've been given. Plus these are people who will also understand that these information gatherers they have their people among them. So you're dealing with a situation that is not quite what we see it as. He's we simplified by saying oh but he gets information. Yes. Then there's implementation. Then put that on hold. Then there is the reality of what the economy is at. We had that discussion with Dr. Mai yesterday and he said the honest conversation as far as I'm concerned is not to treat the current government as a standalone government that isn't influenced by what the previous government did and the one before it. If you do not take that reality into consideration and since the discussion here begins and ends with actually money, we have to ask why is it that we the government seems to be struggling with money. Why? Because that's the struggle. The universities are discussing it is money. When you talk about teachers capitation education money, it is money. When you hear the uh court talking, they are not funded adequately. inadequate. It is money. Why is it that we don't have enough money? We don't have enough money for a very simple reason. Some of it is being hoarded. People who have money are not spending. Mhm. There isn't enough money in the economy to go around. Mhm. Partly because of the way the government is borrowing money. Cuz when the government borrows money then it is safe to borrow lend the government because they'll pay you as opposed to you who might change even your ID and then go somewhere in the part of the country and disappear completely. But also the obligations of government that this government faces are a culmination of what the previous government had. They are called debts. Y okay you can push this can down the road and perhaps even just pay interest. And whether you do or not, if they are due and you must pay all of it, they're in the trillions of shillings that you pay. Now, if we know what we collect 2.3 trillion, 2.5 trillion, the times we've even collected three. If we even work with a figure of three and half of that is going to paying debt, you remain with a half of that amount and then you look at your budget and then we have this crazy budget where you're told your budget is 4 trillion. So already we have a problem. There's a deficit of 2.5 trillion deficit before you even start if you to meet the budget. So the discussion then why don't you budget with 1.5 trillion cuz that's what we have. That is a debate that is still ongoing. If we budget with 1.5 trillion and we are honest about that budget we do know education will just take half of that money. Education take around 600 billion. We know this. Yes. I'm trying to explain I'm trying to say that even that 600 billion I would venture to ask have we audited as to have we asked the question as to why we need 600 billion for education every budget that we have whether it is health whether it's education these monies that we budget for we take it for granted that the arithmetic is correct and we've understood really because those amounts are colossal and the amounts even if dispersed dispersed partially Mhm. The actionability of that is not reflected on the ground as we say. So if you're talking about a government and the reality of what is what are we talking about exactly because all these are realities. Um we're going to host um Professor Manora once again perhaps he will tell us the realities of government because I like the way he explains things um but sometimes I find them very conspiracy based. However, what I'm trying to say is I like his point of view. And to UASu, I wish you all the best in getting this government officials arrested. What I can tell you for free, it ain't happening. This is Radio Generation Nairobi. Are you ready? September 27th, the Shawarma Festival 2025 takes over Two Rivers Mall. Juicy beef, spicy chicken, bone veggie creations. Your ticket gives you three shuarmas, plus a full day of music, games, competitions, and safe spaces for healing. This is where flavor meets freedom. Don't miss it. Get your tickets at madfund.com. Radio Generation, 88.8 Nairobi. This is Radio Generation Traffic. All right. So, um where where are we? Oh, yeah. City and I are having a very interesting conversation over here. Gong road is looking tricky at this particular moment, but it's a very small stretch. I even it's like 300 m junctions. So this is I feel like this is usually the story at exactly between 6:30 and 6:45 complaints. So this is what I will want you to do for me. Um if you see anything on the roads and you think it is of significance. Yeah. Here is our um handle that is at radioenk across all socials. Right. Um literally I can assure you the the roads right now super clear. So if you're heading to work, I would suggest from 7 a.m. like this. I'm certain 100% traffic on radio generation. All right. City is telling me that the realities of running government by they are not as easy as am. No, they are not quite what you think it is, my friend. And let me tell you, even those who take these seats, there's what they think it is. Yes. Then they get there and they realize, my goodness gracious me, this thing is not quite what I thought. It never is what you thought it was. It never is. That's the point I'm trying to make. Okay. And then when you have the makings of something that looks like a coalition government where you brought in all these people who you promise things, it gets really complicated. But me, I'll say this as we get into the papers. Um, we like excusing. Oh no, we don't like but we we we we we will excuse the president to a certain extent. No, this is not exc don't excuse him. Okay, just look at the facts. Don't excuse him. Okay, this these are the facts. Some of the things that the president is dealing with right now, he inherited from previous governments and we will not run away from that fact. However, this same president, sorry, this same president that we would like to to put him in some kind of I don't know, it's not a bubble, but there somewhere we are placing him. And I feel like you know you've gone into the excuse bit. Just look at the facts. Uh don't don't deviate from the fact President William Samo Ruto was in Kbaki's government. He was a minister. He knew the inner workings of Gava because he was in cabinet and he saw what was happening there. Right. Up until of course the time Kbaki fired him. Then he was in President Uhuru's government. Yes. For 10 years he was the principal assistant. And we we will say that you know he was just assisting because there's nothing he could do. He didn't have executive powers until the president actually told him do ABCD. That is when he would do it. But what I'm saying is he was there. Okay. And he used to earn a salary from my taxes. When he became president there's no way we'll start saying but you know he inherited problems. So he did inherit fine but he knew those problems were there. If economists know, if you see Tuga as a as a media personality and a researcher, you know, and yet you are not even in government, you so if you know if I know and I was a student then surely what are we saying about um um the how government should be run. So should I should I should I v for presidency and then God you know God allows me to become president of this country and then I start saying why was you know me I didn't know R did this I didn't know who did this my goodness no I took this job so let me stop excuses the I want to just mention one thing and I'll repeat it there are realities of political positions that You will only know when you've taken the opposition. You will be theorizing about it when you want it cuz you actually haven't sat on that seat. So you don't know. You only know what it is when you're there. Believe me, before you have an idea of what it is when you sit there, that's when you get to know ...",

Heat. Heat. N. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, man. Heat. Heat. Hey baby. Hey, hey, hey. Hey Hey. Okay. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. N. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Please welcome founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LP, Michael R. Bloomberg. Hello. Well, hello everyone and welcome to the Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Forum. Uh, great ways to kick it off. A silverhead heartthrob with movie star charisma and also Harrison Ford. As a matter of fact, I thought that would work. Seriously, let me begin by and incidentally Harrison Ford I know very well. He's a pilot. I'm a pilot. we swapped war stories. Um, a great actor and a really nice guy and very thank thanks to him for doing this. Uh, let me begin by thanking everyone for taking the time to be here, including the heads of state and national delegations. This is a busy week every year with so many leaders gathered here in New York City for the UN General Assembly and there's certainly no shortage of challenges to discuss over there. But the truth is in a world that's more interconnected and fastm moving than ever before the biggest problems can't be solved by national governments alone. And that's what brings this forum together with leaders from business, philanthropy, nonprofits and government. Uh here we are united not as nations but as problem solvers, innovators and doers all bound by a belief that collaboration across the public and private sectors is essential to shared success. No group has all of the answers or all of the resources that we need, but we know that connections fueled progress and today we're here to make more of both. At Bloomberg Philanthropies, we've seen the power of collaboration and partnership. It's at the heart of everything that we do. Our mission is to help the greatest number of people live longer, better lives. In pursuit of that goal, we look for needs that aren't yet met and opportunities that have been overlooked, and we work to bring people together to take them on, just like we're doing here today. Let me give you one example. If you're wearing glasses or contact lenses, you know that what a lifecher they can be. I wear contact lenses and without it, I couldn't read. I couldn't see very well. But in the 21st century, there's no reason why anyone anywhere should have to struggle with fixable vision problems. And yet around 1 billion people do. Poor vision makes it harder for children to succeed in school and it limits people's ability to work and earn a living. And we can't accept that, especially when the solutions are already at hand. Earlier this year, we launched a new effort to bring people together and treat preventable vision problems. Working with partners, we've expanded access to vision screening and training health care professionals to perform cataract surgery. We also distributed more well we will also distribute more than 7 million free pairs of new glasses in countries around the world including here in the United States and I'm glad to announce that one of our lead partners will be an innovative eyeglass company based here in New York City Warby Parker it's an yes they deserve a it is an incredible promising partnership and let me thank everyone at Warby Parker Parker who has been part of it especially its CEO Neil Blumenthal who's with us today. Nice round of applause for him. We're also joined by two outstanding partners working with us on the ground to deliver eye glasses and screenings. the CEO of SL site slavers, Caroline Harper, and the CEO of Vision Spring, Ella Goodwin. Nice round of applause for them. Now, the world is full of opportunities to make a difference, and sometimes they're hiding in plain sight, if you don't mind the pun. Today, we're bringing more of them into focus. Same thing, and begin to form partnerships. It takes tough to re write this stuff uh and they form partnerships that really can fully seize them. We have a great group of distinguished guests and speakers with us. Uh we here are here to change the world. We are doing it. We're going to continue to do it. Bloomberg Philanthropies is honored to be part of it and we would love as much help as any of you can provide. Just give us a call. To get us started, we'll dive right into a subject with implications for virtually every other topic that we're going to cover today with so much potential to change the world we live in and work in. And that's advances in artificial intelligence. Every single story you read talks about artificial intelligence. And we're joined by a leader and innovator who has had an extraordinary career helping to guide big organizations through periods of rapid change. She's the president and chief investment officer at Alphabet and Google. And we're lucky to have her on the board at Bloomberg Philanthropies, Ruth Borat, and she'll be joined in conversation by a longstanding member of the team at Bloomberg News, Francine Laqua. Let's give them both a big warm welcome. Mike, thank you. Thank you so much. Welcome everyone. I hope everyone's having a great day with Poor Ed. I'm so happy to speak to you because AI could change everything for the good, maybe for the worse at certain parts. But where do you think we are in 2025 in terms of advancing technologies and AI, but also adoption? First, great to be here. This is always a wonderful event. So delighted to be here. Look, I think where we are with AI is it is both moving really fast and really slow. And what I mean by that is when you focus on the science, the breakthroughs in science are breathtaking. The pace at which we're seeing advancement. And I think one of the best ways to think about that is actually with my colleague Demisabus who runs Google deep mind and the work he did to develop something called alphafold which is the 3D prediction of protein structures u which is viewed as the single greatest contribution to drug discovery in our lifetime and he went from working on that he's been in neuros neuroscience and and computer science physics for his whole life but four years ago started on this journey to take on what had been a 50-year grand challenge to predict protein structure of uh the protein structures for all known proteins. And in four years he went from an idea that people challenged is it possible and he said why not to a solution which has now been open- sourced three million scientists around the world are using it 190 countries and the Nobel Prize that is the speed of change and we're seeing that across Google Deep Mine what is slow is actually the implementation in both the public and the private sector we're still very early days the excitement about AI is across the board the economic upside four trillion potential contribution to GDP by 2030 with proper application across industry and the public sector what's called diffusion. It's the better delivery of healthcare, better delivery of education and that is still very early days. AI is clearly a lot more than a chatbot. It's about a fundamental rethink of the processes that we have and I would say for each one of us as leaders, we need to start on that journey. So why do you think Ruth adoption is so slow or slower compared to the innovation? Is it because it's capital intensive and chief executives or even countries don't really know where to go next? I think one of the key elements is the prioritization. Where do I begin? Yeah. And I hear that time and time again. And the mental model I keep coming back to the framework actually anchors on health for a host of reasons. One, I think it is so relevant to each one of us. I've had cancer twice and so I look at the application of AI in health care and there's so much reason to be optimistic but when you then think through what are the solutions how do I prioritize actually the insights from health are relevant across all industries so first is saving lives it's innovation it's drug discovery I've already talked about that with alphafold but very importantly what demis said when he was awarded the Nobel prize is I want to take on the most intractable problems And when he was challenged as to whether it was possible, his answer was why not? And I think that's the way we each need to look at innovation regardless of industry. The second is obviously in healthcare early detection is the difference between survival and not in many cases or a really difficult course of treatment. And what is it in cancer? Google pioneered the early detection of metastatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and more. And that is literally proverbial the proverbial needle in a hay stack. finding that early sign of a problem. That is precisely what we do across many different applications. Cyber security is about finding the needle in the haststack. In fact, last year Google DeepMind found with AI that they could see vulnerabilities, find vulnerabilities in software before they were breached. So again, it is fortifying what you were doing in in cyber security. It's true for fraud, etc. And then finally, it's about operating effectiveness. Shortage of doctors and nurses around the globe. What we found with AI is you can free them from about 30% of their work, the administrative basically drudgery. Um, so they can do what we want as patients, focus on you as a patient, focus on what they want to be doing. And again, that is true across public and private sector. And I just was with a CEO this week who said, \"Yes, the application of AI customer support.\" What they're hearing from their employees is, \"Thank you for freeing me from that drudgery.\" And they can do higher level work and it unlocks capital that can then go into innovation. So I think prioritization is key. I think for everyone in this room, each one of us actually getting tactile with AI so that you can see how it's used. I learned how to vibe\r\n",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Israel adm [Music] [Music] le here. Oh Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Praise be the name of his glorious sovereignty forever and ever. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart. And you shall teach them thoroughly to your children. And you shall speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them for a sign upon your hand. And they shall be for a reminder between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorpost of your house and upon your gates. When the word entered the world, freedom entered it. Torah exists only to establish peace. And its highest teaching is love and kindness. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and what is not to and that is the whole Torah. Go learn it. Honoring one another, doing acts of kindness, and making peace. These are our highest duties. is equal to them. So let us learn in order to teach. Let us learn in order to do. She is a tree of life to those who hold fast. All who cling to her find happiness. Her ways are ways of pleasantness. And all her paths are peace. Help us to return to you Lord. Then truly shall we return. Renew the days of our first love. Amen. Together. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Let us not enter into testing, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. Vicki Shekarta Rabba. Thankful is what I am before your face. Okay. Living and eternal for restoring my soul within me with compassion. Great is your faithfulness. Turn to someone and say Shabbat shalom. And have a seat and we'll get started. I've got just a real uh quick few announcements. Uh one of them remember every Tuesday uh we have prayer time at 1. On Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:30 we have mana time for seniors. Uh of course we've had a roshana service. We're still having our yomapor service and our soot service right here uh starting next Wednesday night. Uh, as you know, the year has now begun and our new calendar that has both audio and video built in through QR codes. It's good all the way to 2027 is now available. Uh, the America at War Book is available at half price. And then lastly, I want everyone to know about our Jordan Saudi Arabia tour next year in 2026. Now, I think I've got my volume up. I hope. Here we go. Uh, here are some people. I got some videos of them celebrating Roaches Shana. Here it is up in Alaska. That's Paul and Donna Claus in company. That's a long breath. And then here we have in Kenya, this is in Nairobi, Kenya. I don't know why the video went out, but [Music] can we celebrate the Lord for the Amen. Okay, now look at this. This well is completed at the Jerusalem church. All right. And Jill, I'm not sure if you have Francis's uh Yeah, we got it. USB ready. Come on up, Francis. We have Francis here all the way from Kenya. Yay. Woohoo. Give us an update on what is going on in Kenya. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. Thank you, daddy. Yes. Uh yeah, this is the day that the Lord has made and we have we will rejoice in it. Yeah, this is uh our partnership with Elsadai Ministries here in the US. And today I'm standing here to appreciate and uh uh speak a blessing from all I bring all the greetings from Kenya. Yay. Not only Kenya but from Masai Mara. You see um this everything began here when uh Papa Mark and Bill came to our village and this is where they stayed. This is our village. This is our home and you see we are standing in a in a mountain and it was I just it started when I went to Israel and this uh church sponsored me through El Shadai Ministries to go to Israel. So my trip to Israel was a blessing to us and uh so before that uh this is where we we used to draw water. This is a small pond and we take water from here to and clean it like doing um putting some chlorine on it and after that we put into small buckets and drink. So here this is the water we uh that's the drinking water. That's the drinking water. So we drink this water always. This is in my compound. This is what we used. Our donkeys get inside there. our cows, our dogs, everything. They anyone with a quench when you want to quench your thirst, you just go there, drink, take the cup, take it. But guess what? When Pastor M came and see this and say, \"Lord, it's an incense, we're going to do something.\" So we started from there. So this is the the well that started just beside the small pond you saw and this is the tongue now 20,000 liters up it's already changed a place is so changed so let's go to the next point yeah this is the team this is the church that I I pastor here uh we have um Nashai is our sister from Canada and Papa and uh and me and Bill. So this is the church that they teach. This is the second teaching area when uh then uh from here we went to Jerusalem church which you saw there are this is a this is the Jerusalem church. the the Jerusalem church looks like that and that is a village where uh pastor Mark taught about the Torah. So and we thank God for for you all. Let's go to the next point. The project started from there. This is a distribution of our Bibles and all these kids are preparing for form four. They are going the last year at the high school to go to the to prepare themselves to the university. So it was a team of 100 students and we give everyone a Bible. So, so from uh three of our churches, these students uh I started with them since they were kids and now they are over 18. So, they are running to the next level. So, we started here and that's why they have uh a vision. they written in their t-shirts. We have a vision to take the Torah to nations and inside this I'm training about uh 20 20 missionaries. You have identified places like uh Ethiopia, Northern Kenya, Tanzania. I started training them from low. So I really thank God that we can uh teach them and we are praying that God is going to change for the last 21 years that I've been pastoring across this small region. I want to change the hearts and raise missionaries for the next generation. So these are the children the young girls that I saved them from uh FGM uh the Masai people they have they still have that such kind but now it's a bit silent the they do female general modulation but I saved them and over 80 of them are going to universities high school and that is a celebration then the parents came following them so the parent receive a Bible and the child receive a Bible and they gave me a blanket. Yeah. So they bring that's what they can they can give me. So they they did that. Let's go to the next level. Yeah. This is Jerusalem church. Jerusalem church. It's like you can see over 20 to to 30 kilometers away. And people here they have no water. the there's a small stream that they dig so that when the water flows in the in the river. Thank you my brother Max. And uh so the flowing river will have some little ponds. In every stop there is a pond. In every stop there is a pond. So that's when the the place is dry no rain they go to little ponds. And when Elshadai Ministries president came to our village, it changed everything. There is uh another 10,000 liter tank on top and the the the well is done finished. They started drinking water. This mind-blowing like the the man here we call him Abraham in the Jerusalem church. This old man had four wives and of um 20some children. He said, \"I don't need land for the children for the people to go to church because her uh one of her daughters got sick and the hand had a problem and I prayed and she got healed totally.\" So that is how we got this land. So we got a land and now we have a church on it. Yeah. So and the field is very fertile for this world. We will start training what I saw in Israel about agriculture. This is what we going to do for sustainability and people to have to know how to to do to harvest and uh so that our water will be productive beside drinking and uh and washing clothes and everything else. We're going to teach. We're going to welcome anyone with the skills of of agriculture, horiculture, all that we can teach because we have 80,000 liters per 10 hours. So 8,000 liters per hour. So every 10 hours which the solar because we have a solar, we don't have the the electricity running. So we have we use the solar. So these people here and everyone who has given to this we have a solar. So no day that we can say it has stopped because of paying or anything the solar is up. So everything is running. So when we have this we will go forward. Yeah. So next picture please. Yeah. Uh this lady is the single Messiah lady which I pray we prayed for at the GPS. God did you see that? And uh she's working with the prison. We worked with her for 8 years um reaching prisons and in this prison this is the first time she came to the area and this is interesting. No single Masai lady is in prison. Only 1% in the whole country in Kenya and Tanzania. They have done a research and there is almost zero crimes in in the area where the Masai lives. Yeah. There's no police. There are no police. There's no crime. It's like zero. So that's why the conservations, the animals and all that. We appreciate God or uh also for our fathers like they put everything in place because um learning Torah it's like we have a justice system very working very nicely and we have um a conflict resolution system which is done by elders, women or moran or young people. So they have a level. If you do something beyond the level of elders, then they can just hunt you to the police and that's it. But if you your crime slowly slowly they have the chiefs and other people they have a very nice justice system and um I've been in that um part doing that resolution. If someone has done something which we can solve it. Yeah. By crimes that which are not so bad. So we do that. So these people uh I went here preaching the gospel and also distributing Bibles from here. This lady was went to find people to to help on sanitary sanitary towels, toilet papers because you see the children their their mothers are in prison but the children they cannot separate. So they can the children stay in prison. They stay too in prison. So they have a single uh a way of taking children to land somewhere. But their mothers are been convicted. Some has a serious crime, big ones. But the child is not excluded because so they are almost like everything. So they are churches who partner to give milk uh learning materials, pencils or pens and we give them. So I've been doing this even before. So reaching them, praying for them and teaching uh the gospel and I got an opportunity uh when uh this church came the president under director everyone when they visited we went to a place and I found something to bring to them. Guess what? I found a lady here that she was conficted for 5 years. What happened? I said everyone to say his prayer prayer request and the lady said this is we have a water problem in this prison and I have only three months to leave and everyone was saying oh pray for my case to end pray for every any other problem. I want to see my people. I want to see my parents. I want to see my mother. I want to see my father. I want to see this. I left my car home. You know these people. But one single person said it's a problem because they they go to the river to draw water. All the guards and the prisoners, the inmates. But yeah, the guards are not excluded. They go all to the water and they take bath. Pastor Mark was there. We went to the river across the road and a lady from Canada just bathed in the river because we didn't have bathrooms. So he just like did that and this is what they do. So and when I shared the picture with pastor Mark he said tell them that prayer is answered. This prison was started as a concentration camp in 1952 50. In 1952 it became a prison and up to now they don't have a single well. They go to a Mara river draw water and bring it in buckets every two days. So now we have a well. Let me jump in there a second. What's amazing that lady, she gets out in three months from the jail. Yeah. Her prayer was that the prison would get a well even though she won't be helped by it, but that was her goal. And now we have a prison with a well. Yeah. And through this, the Kenyan government through the permanent secretary of the prisons all of Kenya signed a letter for me to to do uh prison ministry. So when papa you come, we go to the biggest prison in Kenya. The big Yeah. So just because we put the well at the prison, the government has given us free access to every prison. I mean that's just yeah they don't they they uh they they really the government don't allow any picture to be taken through the prisons but because of wellw wishes we use this for what we are doing today. So many people are happy for that. Okay, let's see. Go to the next one. Yeah. Uhhuh. This is Yes. This is a the prison god. Yeah. The prison god and this is the leader and our the lady is leading the other side. Yeah. Oh. Ah. This Yeah. This is the well. This is it the day. So, we're really happy. This guy is the one who did the geological survey. And this is the day you see this uh man is uh the prison chaplain. Yeah, the prison chaplain. But every person is trained. They don't allow any civilian to preach there. But I found an opportunity. I don't have any training military history. But I do I do the best. Yeah. And this is what happened. 400 people 450. We had only 50 people who are Christians. But by the end of this sermon, all the 400 were crying. 400. Glory to God. Let's go to the next one. Next slide. Yeah. The I think that Yes. Oh my goodness. You Oh, this one. You can't miss this. I met this old man three years ago and two of his sons died because one died through a bullet and the other one died through um an elephant hit. And this old village, they live in northern Kenya. So that's Muslim area. Yeah, this is Muslim area and it's the only village without a mosque. Yeah, these are these are Masai speaking people in northern Kenya. So they they are and they are exploited. They are almost assimulated by Muslims. That's this is those homes I showed you with the wood sticks and clothes over it. Yes. That's the people that live up there. Yes, that is the people live up there. So, we we will we will we are praying I've been praying for the last two years about this after corona. I visited there and now we are praying that we they can get water for this village because this is the only thing they have abandoned two abandoned schools and uh I went there. There is um some photos for the school which is closed there. The government is giving them teachers uh but books, pencils and bros they don't they don't buy for them. The parents should buy and here nothing growing. Cows go very far because they are pastoralist and we are praying for this village. They were really desperate. That is how they live. Yeah. I lived in this homes some years back but now the Masai there are still Masai people who live like this but this one is so much Yeah. This is next slide. Yeah. Next one. Next slide. Yeah. Mhm. This is uh our suahili bibles in Korea which we gave in the in Tanzania Tanzanian border. Tanzanian border. The pastor that we are working with is a teacher.

Where they say go, I go and they come, I come. Yeah. Yes. I am in the through the this church. Now I am in the Bible society. This is the director and they are using my picture in the Bible society for the Masai Bibles. They so they are using my picture because now we bought over 2,000 which is not which is it's not a simple thing to buy such a great This is a Masai village. We went to see the Morans. The Morans are like a kind of protection for the Masai people. It's a process. It's an initiative process which they go before they do the initiation they go for Moran. After the initiation they become morans and they they experience and learn about Masai people. So and through this we went to the Amanata. These are homes with this small sticks. I I wish for home. Yeah these are homes. This is where they live. The children here they they are nursing children. So they are their mothers are here. Their fathers are here and we are here. and they didn't allow to preach the gospel because it's it's it's a total different uh culture but through uh God's grace I had an opportunity to do that. You see these are houses like the same one but in the other area it's very dry. So going to let's go do Yes. So we took water with a tank with a tractor. So this is what we did. Sugar, water, and Bibles same day. Thank you. Go ahead. Yeah. These are people who are appreciating about the Bibles.

Then they all received their Bibles. Is that amazing? Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you all for such a blessing. This is uh the pence in the village in in the northern village. So we thank God for that. Thank you very much for your prayers and support. Thank you daddy. I appreciate everything. That's why yeah for the last 15 years I've been waiting for a day like this since I knew Mark back in those years. Yeah. in uh back 2010 up to date and one single visit has changed my life and my village. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you. Go ahead. You go ahead. Uh what a blessing to have him here uh with us. Let's see. All right. Now, one thing I wanted to mention before we set up and worship. How many of you have ever heard of the Tower of Babel? Okay. If you remember what that was, uh this was after the flood. And this is mankind's uh response to God. It's like, you want to go to war, God? Let's go to war, you know. Well, as many of you know, Tower of Babel represents all the nations coming together against God. Well, this last week here we have the uh European Union recognizing the state of Palestine and it's like they're raising their fist. But here this last week of course we have or the last few weeks we've had the total uh lunar eclipse. We've had the solar eclipse and I believe this is God is saying he's about to bring his fist down uh on the rest of the world that are want to divide his land. What I think it's fascinating is many of you have heard of the ring of fire that goes all the way around the Pacific uh ocean. For the first time in history, this last July saw the largest number of earthquakes over the magnitude of seven in a single month. In just this last July, there was a 7.3, 7.4, 7.0, and an 8.8. All in July. The next month was the month of Alul with the lunar eclipse. The next month was Tishry with the solar eclipse. Well, what do we see in August? There was a 7.5. In September, a 7.4. September 18th, the 7.8. And what does the Lord do in the middle of all of that? He brings in the uh lunar eclipse, the solar eclipse. And so, and right in the middle of that, God trying to speak to the nations. We have a tower babble response with the EU. putting their fist up saying, \"We're going to divide your land. We are in charge, not you.\" See, God is the one who created all the borders for all the nations. It says, \"All right. Well, now the EU says the UN and we get to determine where borders are.\" So, this is a real in-your-face thing to God. Well, what is fascinating is when you get on God's time schedule, I'll have you know right now we time wise every row represents seven years. There's one year, two years, three, four, five, well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is called a schmita week. Seven years. All right? And there's seven going down. But I want you to notice here we are. Uh now this was in uh yeah 2013 2016 tower of babel being uh built toward the end of the first cycle well of a jubilee year. I think it's fascinating. Here's where Abraham receives the promise on Passover. But it was right here when Abraham exits Babylon and he comes to the promised land right here. He but then he goes down to Egypt, returns to Canaan, separates from Lot. Lot's captured, encounters Mechisedc, and then it's right here. He receives uh the promise on Passover, and it was a schmita year. So, the Schmidita years are very important. We're going to take a look at that more later. Uh but we also have our Genesis book with the 5-hour Hebrew audio download. It comes along with it. We also have our gospel book uh that is now available. And we have our uh part two from Acts to Revelation. Should be here in about 6 weeks. And right here is what it looks like inside. Here we have not only the Gospels, but the rest of the New Testament coming in Hebrew with the transliteration. With that said, let's stand. Had a long announcements this time, but hey, what can I say? We enjoyed having Francis with us. Amen. All right. Lord Ainu Moanu, our father, our king. We just thank you so much for everything you're doing in each one of our lives. And right now, Lord, I just pray that you would give every single one of us eyes to see, ears to hear, and a heart to understand in Yeshua's name. Amen.

Uh for some reason, this is the second week in a row we've had a problem with Facebook, but we have people on YouTube that are watching and of course on our live stream, but right now we have people watching from all 50 states including Canada, India, Netherlands, Australia, the UK, the Virgin Islands, Kenya, Nigeria, Cayman Islands, all over. Yay. Well, so excited. Okay, today the Torah portion is vi which means and he went. This is referring to our uh opening verse here in Deuteronomy 31:1. And Moses went and he's speaking to all of Israel. And look what he said. Today's my birthday. And he is 120 years old. So it's a happy birthday. And for Moses that was on the seventh day of the month of Adar. And in Deuteronomy 31 6-8 he's telling all of Israel to be strong and of a good courage. Don't fear. Don't be afraid because they're about to go in and take the promised land. Too many people walk in a spirit of fear. Yes. I'm serious. They just walk in a spirit of fear. What in the world are you afraid of? You know, I tell you what, this this life is a vapor. It's a wind. It passes away. If you don't believe in an afterlife, oh my gosh, I would be full of fear. But if you realize dying is just changing clothes, that's all it is, you know. And I am not here for this world anyway. I'm passing through. And so for me, uh, my I don't want to say the greatest fear is not getting the mission done God's called me to do. Before I go, I say, God, don't take me out till I've at least accomplished what you've want me to accomplish. And but then he says, God will not fail you. He won't forsake you. And then Moses calls Joshua and says in front of everybody, be strong and of a good courage. Okay? God's going to go with you into this promised land. And he says, \"God is not going to fail you. He's not going to forsake you. So don't be afraid.\" Now, here's what's amazing. Look at Deuteronomy 3:19. Moses wrote the Torah. He delivered it to the priests that bore the ark of the covenant. And he puts this book into the Ark of the Covenant. Now, look at Deuteronomy 17:15. I'm going to jump back a few chapters. Moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years, you hear that? At the end of every seven years, in a year of release, okay, what is that called? Schmita year. It's a schmita week, which means a week of seven years. And the seventh year is the Schmita year. And so God says at the end of every seven years in the year of release, but look at what day it is to be done on. What day does it say? You guys know English. It's on your notes. Okay. Feast of tabernacles. What day do you proclaim the year of Jubilee? I mean, what day? What day do you proclaim the year of Jubilee? Yamapore. So Yom Kapor every 50 years on Yomkapor you declare the year of jubilee but every seven years you proclaim the year of liberty on the feast of tabernacle. So yum kapor is jubilee tabernacles is every seventh year. That's going to be important to remember and you'll see why in a minute. Okay let's see. Oh, I skipped Deuteronomy 17:15. Look at this. God says, \"When you come into the land the Lord your God has given you, you possess it. You dwell in it, and you're going to say, I want a king like all the nations.\" God says, \"You shall surely set a king over you, but it has to be the one that God chooses. From one among your brethren, you shall set as king. You may not set a foreigner who is not your brother.\" So, what does that mean? They can't have a Hittite be the king of Israel. They can't have an Ammonite, a Moabitete, an Edomite. Okay, got that? I mean, that would make sense, you would think. Okay, now look at this. In Deuteronomy 31:10-12, it says it has to be done in the seventh year on the Feast of Tabernacles and the place God chooses, which is Jerusalem. you have to read this Torah before all of Israel in their hearing. Now, that's not the entire five books, but there was sections that they had to read, which was very important, and you will see why. It says, \"You have to read it before all of Israel in their hearing, gather everyone together, the men, the women, the children, your stranger.\" Who would have the authority to do that? The king. No one else has the authority to tell everyone you drop what you're doing and you come here right now on this day and we're going to read this. Okay. And so that is called does anyone know that what that's called every seven years when the king comes together and says everybody to come. It's called the hakeel. Hakl. That's what it means. everyone comes together and then the king would stand up and he would read certain sections of the Torah. Well, look at this. Jeremiah is like 500 years later. Well, a thousand years from Moses, 500 years from David. And look what it says in Jeremiah 34:13-15. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I made a covenant with your fathers when I brought him out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And now he's quoting what we just read in Deuteronomy. He says at the end of seven years, every man has to set free his Hebrew brother who's been sold. When he serves six, you're to let him go free. But look at this. Your fathers never did obey me. And now you recently turned and did what...",

If you have your Bibles, please turn with me to the book of John, the Gospel of John, chapter 4. We're going to read a very long pass portion of scripture today. So, I will not ask you to start because you get tired. In our home, we normally read through the Bible and we normally do rotation. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. N. Others have done the hard work and you have the benefits of their labor. Verse 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony. He told me everything I ever needed. So when Samitas came to him, they asked him to stay with them and he stayed 2 days and because of these words maybe more believers. They say to the woman, we no longer believe just because of what you said. Now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world. Our God and our father, we thank you because of this message that you have prepared us for us today. As I deliver this message, I pray for clarity. Oh, I pray for courage. I pray for confidence. I pray for your inspiration that you may use me. I also pray for the listeners this morning that God you may open their hearts that they may receive this message. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. I will title the message this morning spreading the gospel. Spreading the gospel. It is one of the neglected ministries in the church today. It is one of the ministries that is not emphasized today. I'm asking when did you last share the gospel to anyone in the past few years? I don't want you to raise your hands but ask yourself why did you share the gospel? Why did you ask somebody to receive Jesus? Those of us sitting here this morning, have you led anyone to Christ? Have you led anyone to Christ? If you are sincere enough, I think very many few months would go up because if that was the case, we would not have a room for the people in churches today. So it's true that it's not it's a ministry that has been even me I don't remember the last time I spoke about witnessing to sharing the gospel the last year when we were about to open the church we organized for doortodoor evangelism and open air crusade and actually it became an eye opener to us. We realized how he equipped our people are to do the right to witness. Majority of the banks that we moved around were actual visitors but our old members were perishing. So it is indicating that that area is lacking. We have so many departments in this church. We have the praise and worship. who have just led us in a wonderful session of worship. We have the choir, we have the usher who are doing a wonderful job there. We have the security, we have the project department, we have the missions. But it's unfortunate that we don't have a strong and vibrant outreach empowerment in our church. How we hope to grow if we don't reach out to our community. How we hope to fulfill the great commission if we don't share the gospel. Sharing the gospel is a command. We are not commanded to seek. We are not commanded to do all these other mysteries. But when Jesus actually finished his work on earth, he left one command to the disciples. He told them, \"Go preach the good news to the whole world.\" That is a command that we've given. We call it the great commission. But some people have said this is the great omission. We have omitted the great work that God has called us. So this morning using the story that we have read our challenge each one of us to take up this great mission that God has given us to share the good news. In this very long text, Apostle John actually did it deliberately. This is the longest conversation that Jesus had with anybody. He did not even have a long conversation with disciples the way he did to this woman. And the writer of this text decided to record it. However long it is, he recorded it because it is very important. It is very important. Number two, the position of this story is also very important. It was after chapter 3. In chapter 3 of the book of John, there is another conversation. This time it was conversation with Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a Jews religious leader, a very friendship and a very rich man. The Bible say he came to Jesus at night and had a conversation with him about issues with eternal life. And then chapter four another conversation with a nameless we are not given the name of this American woman. We are not told but by the description she was a noble. So we are coming from a very influential leader to a noble which is an indication that John wanted to let us know that Jesus is concerned about all of them. He's concerned about the rich intellectual the religious leaders just the way he's concerned with the people who are nobodyies in society. And the last part which this text is important is it addresses the fundamental truth of the scripture that Jesus came to seek and to save the lost soul that is his mission. So out of this text we can know those three parts. Now as we go through this story that's why I deliberately read the whole text because there are so many lessons that we can learn about reaching out. And today I'm going to take you through very quickly on six lessons that we can learn from this. Something that we can learn about reaching out to those who are reaching out to the gospel. The first thing that we see here is about barriers. Barriers in the gospel. We see this in verse 9. Verse 9 um says the Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a king. I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a dream?\" These were two people who are already facing some barrier and there are about three barriers here. Number one, there is a cultural barrier. The Jews and the Samaritans had different cultures and it emanated from what happened in 722 BC when the nation of Israel was taken into captivity. All the young men, women, ablebodied people were taken captiv captivity. The land was left almost empty. Very old and sick and people could not go the distance were left behind. Now the empty land was later occupied by foreigners who came to settle and they intermarried with the remnants the people who were made and as a result a new group of people emerged. People were not fully Jews and they were not fully Gentiles. They had a little element of Jews culture and a little element of Jews of Gentile culture. So when the other two years back they found this corrupted corrupted culture corrupted religion and there is a rift that developed between these two. So they could not agree and therefore gentile not gentiles but Samaritans and Jews were not relating in any way. So when Jesus talked to this woman she was surprised. You are a Jew. How how can you do this? How can you speak to me? You are you are of a different culture. Number two is that this was a woman. The Bible specifically said he talked to a Samaritan woman. A woman. The Jewish culture also did not allow men to speak to a woman especially when alone. In fact, Jews women were regarded very low. And that's why the Bible when it talks about it counted people, when Jesus said 5,000, he said 5,000 men, he didn't count the women because they were not part of the population. So in fact there's a Jews prayer which Jews man pray that I thank you Lord that you did not create me a woman a gentile or a dog according to the Jews a woman a gentile and a dog are of same category so that's how Jews despise a women so when Jesus actually address this woman. He was actually this woman. And how do you know he was small? Number one, he was going to fake water. In the Jews culture or in that culture, women used to have servants. Able to rich women would have servants and that is the work of ser. So the fact that she herself was going to fake water show showed economic status. Number two, she was not married to the Jews was actually licensed to own property. When we are not married, you don't own anything because everything belong to the man. So this woman did not have anything. So he was he was poor. The Bible talks about coming to the well at noon. That was also indicating something about her. This was the time where no one was around. No one was well drinking water. Traditionally women could drink water early in the morning or late evening but not at noon. So there was this woman was avoiding something meaning that she was lonely. This woman was lonely. This woman was rejected. This well that Jesus found him was a very distant well. She had actually passed other ways. Meaning there was something that was driving her to go very far positively because she was not accepted in the community where she she came from. So she was a rejected woman. So again it brings in the issue of a barrier. How do we reach out to these people? Another one was a spiritual barrier. When Jesus introduced the message, she was very quick to say you Jews worship in Jerusalem. We worship. We don't worship in Jerusalem. There was a religious barrier. There was a religious barrier. Another thing about this spirituality is about a lifestyle. Jesus confronted her. You are you don't have a husband and even the one that we're living with is not yours. So again revealing the sinful life that she was actually. So in this passage we see a very important lesson that barriers should not prevent us from sharing the gospel. Praise the name of the Lord. That no barrier should actually prevent you from sharing the gospel. Whether it is cultural, whether it is social, whether it is spiritual, we should not allow it to to to prevent us. Every time the first thing that you you normally encounter, somebody will tell you I am I am belong to this religion or I belong to this denomination. So by that he's telling him there is no need for you to witness to me. It doesn't matter. Maybe he attended only once or he got baptized many years ago. It doesn't matter. But the fact that he has become he has joined a certain religion that actually shield or from with from the gospel. So some people use religion as a barrier. Some use revolution. Sometimes we fear to witness to certain people. Possibly there are people high in society. Maybe they look rich, influential and powerful. And we ask ourself, do these people need the gospel? Do these people need this message? How can a young person, how a poor person, how can I be able to share the gospel to this very rich and very influential person? Or sometimes the person will be very low in society. It could be the people that have been classified as very low people in society. How can I be able to share the gospel of these people? Maybe if I start a conversation, this man will begin maybe asking for support or asking for begin to be something from me. So we normally shy away from sharing the gospel based on economic background. On Thursday we hosted the bon in my home for for lunch. My wife had started the ministry to reach out to these people. Normally they come sit there as they waiting for passengers and at one time she started a conversation and managed to convince them to come for lunch and we had a very good time with them and they confessed that many people look down upon them. Most people consider them a social conflict that they warn our children be careful of the border border people. They are not good people. So they confess that we are not treated very well in society. And many of them confess that they are not part of any church. They don't go to church on Sundays. And many of them confess also that they've got a little habits that are not very good. In fact, they say some of the work that they doing is not very beneficial because many of them ended up betting many some ended up bringing an order and we were able to reach them uh and invite them to go to whichever church that they really wanted and we were very blessed and all the response. That is an example of crossing the barriers. Crossing the barriers to reach out to other people. Some of us have workers at home. Have we actually share the gospel this year? Whether it's outside or household or some of us also are privileged to have workers in our school work. Some of us have bosses out there. Can we be able to reach out to them for the gospel or we have allowed these positions socio economic status to hinder us from crossing these boundaries. Jesus in this story is telling us we need not to allow these barriers to prevent us. Number two, it's about opportunities. The Bible says that Jesus left Judea and went to Galilee. If you can look at that map, Judea is south. Gal is up in the north. Traditionally because of the relationship between the Jews and the Gentiles, they avoided going through Samaria. In fact, they crossed over over the Jordan River to that place called Ber and then went up and then crossed the river again at the top somewhere near the Sea of Cal so that they were they could avoid going through Samaria. But on this particular day, Jesus decided to go through Samaria. Uh I did I think he did that intention because he wanted to get that message that it is important even this. Now look at what is happening here. Number one, he met this woman at the well. He met this woman at the well. A well is a common place where everybody goes. A well is not a religious place. It was not a church service. It was not a crusade. It was not one of the programs that we make. It is an ordinary place. What does this mean? God actually present opportunities in any place, even in ordinary places. Number two, it was at noon. It was at noon. A time that it was not expected. You see if it was in the morning we would assume that he knew that so many women would be coming to fake water. So he would take advantage of the numbers. Uh it could be to be accepted but it was a where no one expected again we know that the cost must be shared at any time the opportunity present itself. You don't have to wait for Sunday. You don't have to wait for the day we organize for doortodoor evangelism. We don't have to wait for people to come to church. We need to do it where we find them. It could be in the marketplace. It could be in the shop. It could be in the place of that could be righteous. It was not the plan encounter. Jesus arranged that I was going to meet this woman. This woman arrived. He knew that he was going to meet Jesus. Everybody was on this on this business. This man was coming for water. Jesus was on this journey going to to them to Gary. It was not hard. Again, we learned that doing evangelism sometimes does not require prior arrangement. God actually presents an opportunity for you and we need to use it. You know the story of the Ethiopian unac. Philip was his way and the Philip was suddenly going on his journey also and it began a coincidence that the Philip was reading the book of Isaiah and Philip was also there and he had been reading and from that he established a conversation about what he was reading and through that Philip was able to lead the children to Christ and eventually baptize him. Yes, God presents opportunities. It presents opportunities in many places. Another point is that do not underestimate the value of one one person. Jesus spend time with this one woman. It was not I don't know whether it was economical in terms of time to spend all your time and energy on this one person. But Jesus knew the importance of one. Verse 43, we see the impact of that one. Verse 43, it says after 2 days, it's not um after 2 days he left for Galilee. Now Jesus himself has appointed one Oh no, it's not verse 14. It is. Let's begin from 39. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's wisdom. He told me everything I did. So when Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with him and he stayed two days and because of the his words many more became believers. You see the result of investing in this one woman and investing your time and energy in this one woman later on a whole town actually came to believe in Jesus as a result of this. Jesus ignored this woman and maybe waited for an opportunity to have a big open air concert in in town or a big service somewhere that opportunity could have been lost. So Jesus saw the importance of one soul one person one person he was able to reach many because of that we've seen people you use creatively of God even in this church I remember when came here a few years ago we didn't know the potential that he He was just a lone missionary not sent by anybody without support. We didn't even know what he was doing. He even his physical appearance was not the way he is today. He was a very strong slender young man. Um so he requested that we partner with him. Um actually we after some discussion we accepted we welcomed him to be part of this congregation. We left him for training at NC fish where we supported him for 2 years after graduation. He left back to the missionary and when we you hear about um the places he has sent you heal the other day that he was in Niger. He has seen in Jan, he has seen Tanzania, very many of those countries and like right now he's talking about last year for example in Europe where doors are opening there to reach out. You can ask yourself is was it worth it investing with this person? The answer is yes. Sometimes investing in one person actually may bring a lot of results in the kingdom of God. So let's not underrate the importance of one one soul who comes to Christ. The Bible says heaven rejoices when one person repents. Praise the name of the Lord. If heaven is happy, how should we be happy when one soul repents? Next point is that it starts with a simple conversation. Sharing the gospel does not require a lot of theology. It does not require you to know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. All you need is to know how to reach out to him. First of all, let's establish a relationship. It started with water here. Please give me some water and that's how the conversation began actually portray themselves as a person who needs sometimes we need to put ourselves in that position so that we can have relationship with others. I remember a family where one day they sent the child to go and request for south Truth be here. So sometimes we actually need to show that we also need so the moment they give us then they will also free to come here. So in other words, we'll establish a relationship. Actually, Jesus was doing the same. He could have actually picked a mother for himself, but he wanted to have the conversation, the relationship with this woman. And through that, he was able to lead to this real need. By the way, we believe from health needs. Felt needs are what we go through in life. Siasa, politics, financial challenges, the weather, squeezy, squeezy, squeezing. We we need and then we go deeper to the real needs of the people which are the deep spiritual needs of these people. And that's how Jesus took this woman from literal water to the real deep need of this woman that the issue of salvation and and that is exactly what he did. He was able to lead them this person to know Jesus as Lord and Savior of this life. Many people write Bible normal things. I remember some years back when I was in the school ministry, I was ser as a chaplain in the school and we used to have morning devotion which started at 5 in the morning. Initially everybody did not know believe that it was not going to succeed because students were in number five who are praying the whole school was it wasn't something anybody was but when we started they were few but slowly the numbers increased until the whole student body were assembling by five to listen to God. So many people were shocked and I was also shocked because I didn't know I was going to succeed in this. But it was one year ago I met one of the students who was is now a man you but he was a student at that time and he he revealed the the the truth to me. He told me do you know the reason why we are coming in the morning? Why we waking up? He said it was because of the stories that you used to share. Actually it was around 207 208 and the political tension of the country was very high. So every morning I would share with them what was happening from there. So this is what has happened. This is so everybody wanted to come and hear what is this new thing that is happening. So I will share that one and then use read a portion of scripture and pray and that is that end up being a channel which I can be able to witness on the word of God. So it starts the conversation. It starts the conversation. How are you? How is your family? How are children doing? How is your business? How is this country? Some of us have football which seems to be doing well and through that you can be able to lead somebody to Christ. The the other point is that everyone can be used by God. Everyone can be used by God. We are all called to be witnesses. We are all called to be witnesses. as I've already stated will be commanded and it does not matter your social status. It does not matter your economic status or spiritual status. We are all called to be witnesses. This power woman did not meet any qualities any qualities of the servant of God. A woman who had been married five times and was in a wrong marriage. A woman who was a social med and a survivor which does not meet all the qualities of anyone who attend any message to anybody but we see the results when he took out the task and became as a a witness many people came to Christ. So I want to challenge this morning that any one of us whether you are young, you are old, you are rich, you are poor, you are a man, you are a woman, we are called to be witnesses. Praise the name of the Lord. Even the students out there, you are called to be witnesses, you are called to be witnesses of Christ in the schools where you are in your places of business. Any one of us can be used by God. There is no one who is considered unlikely. The Bible have many full of examples of people who are used by God. In the book of Kings, people of leprosy were used by God to rescue the people of his side. God even used a donkey to speak. God used a blind beggar to witness. By the way, the most influential where you reaching out to is a testimony. It's a testimony. In fact, what this woman did was only to share testimony. He went to them and said, \"You know what? I have met a man who has told me everything about myself told would this be the prophet, the Messiah?\" And people were interested because she was sharing his encounter with Jesus. Remember the story of the blind man where Jesus healed him and then he went out and the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were more happy. So one time they met this man in the crowd and they asked him, \"Are you the man who who was healed?\" He said, \"Yes.\" Do you know the man who healed you is a sinner? But the man who responded, he said, I don't know. I don't know that man. All I know is that I was blind but now I see. That is all I know. And that's a testimony. This is what happened to me. I don't know much. You don't have to know justification, glorification, sanctification. I don't know what all those complex knowledge is. All you need to know is that Jesus saves. This is the way I am. I was and this is the way I am now. This is what I've experienced and that is what it means to share the gospel. You can be you God can use anyone. God can use anyone in business. Um They can sometimes use um sales agents to go out to market a product but sometimes they use customers to market an agent to to market a product. For example, look at this situation. A sales agent comes to you and tells you this is the best speaker. This is the best in the market. You need to buy it. And then somebody from product comes to you and tells you we have used this speaker for the last 8 years and as s cannot break. The sound is wonderful. Which one are you going to buy? Which I the one that is being saved by a salesman or the one person who has used it? The person who has used it. Yes. the power of a satisfied. We can be witnesses of Christ. You don't have to be evangelist or a pastor or anybody. All you need to know is you are you you have benefited from Christ that qualifies you to be a witness. The other one is the principle of sewing and reaping. That one is found in verse 37. Jesus talked about two people. One is sewing and another one is reaping. The one who is sewing will not see the results. Sewing is somewhere the seed and forgetting about it. That is sometimes how witness is. Sometimes you only share and you don't see the response. They must make a decision or they can even plant reject now. So sometimes can be discouraging but I think this is what Jesus is saying. He's saying there is a time for sewing and there is also time for harvesting. Peter Capu the founder of A was just in this country for 3 years. He lived only for 3 years and he died. But today we have more than a million followers of NC because he planted the sick and others after the city. So don't get tired sewing the sick and witnessing because in the due time we will see the others. Finally, leading others to Christ is the most fulfilling work. Verse four, the disciples comes back. They find Jesus still in the same place. They left him and they asked him and let me read from that one. Meanwhile, his disciples acting, rabbi, eat something. But he said to them, I have food. Eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples say to each other, could someone have brought him food? Verse 34, my food, say Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent him and to finish his work. In other words, he's saying, I fulfillment and happiness by wickedness, by doing the will of God. That is what gives me joy. That is what gives me happiness. It's not the food. It is not a career. It is not the success in business. It is not the houses that I build. It is not the positions that I have. It is doing the will of God that gives me fulfillment and happiness in life. So I want to remind each one of us this morning that there is something there is a post that God has started in this world. There is a mission that God has started. And the most fulfilling thing in life is to be part of that mission. To be part of that course is the most fulfilling most fulfilling thing. Yesterday I attended a prayer day and the student tires and I saw one but I didn't have I wish to speak I would have recognized that. There is one boy who wrote pastor and I think many of you are surprised and I think if your son or a daughter comes home and tells you my career is to be a pastor you will ask for prayers. This one is now cutting a direct license to poverty and all kinds of problems. But let me tell you the other side. Doing God's work is the most fulfilling work because it is actually what God has done. It is very fulfilling to do God's work. We thank God all for the different that you have in this church. Those of you who are in will tell you how joyful it is to be in God's service to come here every week for my practice and practice all this good mission here. It keeps me All those significance processes millions of political will remain here. And I know my father. we have done something about us. So that is why we say it is why I have something more important and more. So this morning I want to please the community members are their Here I am big. Oh, it could be anybody else. It could be. It could be. Come to the end. Last question. How many of you with the I may Yes. ask us. We also keep us in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. We have this great and Wow. Generation Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is the most beautiful. So we will help you again. that doesn't ask. In the name of you this morning Yeah. I pray that you give with them. Use them for the glory and honor of your name. I pray for the rest of the church that God we are not seated back but we are also here that you use us in the outfit and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. You can use us oh God. We are asking for forgiveness whatever that we have gone astray and we go even my father go now in the ministry strengthen us once again and use us for the glory and honor of your name. I pray for these three hours right now in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit we pray and believe. Amen. God bless you so much. You are blessed of the lord and may God bless you for the glory and honor in the name of Jesus. I want us to thank God because of the message of the delay for the message and all of us we are here so that we can serve God. I want us to pray as the choir house. Last week also we had announced that Kinder Care are going to present. I don't know if they are ready because you are there today but we can just shout out the choir because they have come. We pray for the offerings. Let's prepare ourselves to give the tithes. Uh I'm reminded will be on fourth that is next week. You're welcome Kaka next week to present. Let's pray for the offerings.

         "Abdul Rahman knew at this point that he had two choices: either meet this with hostility, anger, and maybe even violence (which would have been the short path), or venture on the long and difficult road to recovery through patience, which was the road that so many of the Prophets had tread. He chose the path of the Prophets. He gave up his prestigious medical career and easy life, and along with his wife Umm Suhaib, returned to Africa to dedicate their lives to healing the people there – physically, emotionally, mentally, but most importantly, spiritually.\nPlanting the Seeds\nIn 1980, al-Sumait started an initiative that eventually became Direct Aid. On his initiative, al-Sumait said that “ the aim was to help societies that the world has forgotten and to develop them, so we tried to develop these societies by providing education programs amongst other things ”. The organisation provided schools, healthcare centres, wells, and mosques. One of the main seeds they planted was the welfare of orphans. They would nurture these orphans from a young age with the education and support they needed, until they graduated from university, some even with postgraduate Master’s degrees.\nOne of the main things that Abdul Rahman noticed was that despite the majority of countries with Islam as their main religion having up to a 60% Muslim population, the government and ministers of these countries were mainly Christian. The reason for this was that the average Muslim child barely made it to secondary school, whilst the Christian child had help to progress through to higher education, enrol in a university outside of Africa, and return as a doctor or a politician. What was Abdul Rahman’s solution to this? He founded universities in Tanzania, Zanzibar, and Kenya.\nThe fruition of sowing these seeds became clear in a short amount of time. After al-Sumait’s death, there was a gathering of foreign ministers in Kuwait, where even the Foreign Minister of Malawi attended. He asked to be taken to the grave of al-Sumait, which he visited according to the Islamic tradition. When asked why he had chosen to come here, he answered that he was one of the orphans that had been sponsored by Abdul Rahman.\nNear enough 40 years later, Direct Aid now has 34 offices in 40 African countries.\nThe Mission of the Missionaries\nAbdul Rahman mentioned to a trusted friend of his how, in 1972 whilst he was studying in Britain, he heard of a convention that was taking place in Colorado attended by most heads of nations along with the Pope. Their agenda was Africa and how by the year 2000, the entire continent would follow Christianity. They had taken this task upon themselves and gathered a huge amount of wealth and resources in order to fulfil this mission, along with the full support of the Vatican. His friend narrated that Abdul Rahman did not expand any further into the matter or say what he intended to do – he only returned back to Kuwait.\nFor the next three decades, Abdul Rahman became a thorn in the Vatican’s side. Whilst Christian missionaries were many and took full advantage of the hunger and poverty in the region by trading bread for Christian conversion, Abdul Rahman provided for whoever was in need, regardless of colour, creed, or race. There were entire villages of Muslims who had given up their religion and accepted Christianity in exchange for food and water. Al-Sumait, on the other hand, insisted that the people learned their own languages, culture, and even songs. He did not want any political interference and remained adamant that there should be no middle man between the aid and the people. He accurately manifested the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and showcased to the world that Islam was the only real solution to any form of racism or bias. Naturally, this caused problems for Abdul Rahman, and there were at least two assassination attempts against his life. Allāh saved His servant so he could continue with this blessed work.",

If you have joined through the mobile you will get two option one is the chat and the other one is the Q&A. I mean it is it is absolutely fantastic to put all your queries into the Q&A and u we will come back with the answers once the presentation is over. Right. So let's let's get started now. I would um welcome and u you know request promoter to take the lead. Let's get started. Talk about the brands and the business opportunities that you're offering to uh the investors. Yeah. Over to you sir. Good morning and good afternoon everybody. My name is Pramot Chabria. I'm the co-founder of RAP Motors. I we have been in automo line for a long long time. Earlier we were into retail having showrooms of Yamaha, Atul Auto, Escorts, Class Harvesters, Jansets so on and so forth. About 20 years back we got into the manufacturing of three wheelers. So we have been manufacturing now three wheelers for the last 20 years. Can you put up my company profile now or somebody can put that up? Sure. We have been manufacturing the for the last 20 years and what the company that we are running was a 100% EOU. No domestic sales like I jokingly say we did a what I call a China and India we copied to Bajad machine totally and go to the photographs this is all data there's one more company profile with PP which is in PPT I prefer if that is shown so we got into three wheel manufacturing of three wheelers and we started exporting so far. So far, I can do one thing. I can send the PPT on uh WhatsApp right now. So, you can uh put that up. Okay, sir. Sure. We can do that. Yeah. Me? Yeah. I'm just sending you the P50 right now, so you can put that up. Okay. Okay. This is called Murphy's law. What you want at that time doesn't come and it is available when you are not bothered about it. Anyway, you we can I'll just put up on PPT which is not what I wanted to show to you. But something is better than nothing. You can just put the we sent you by WhatsApp just now. So we started manufacturing three wheelers and we started exporting them. We so far we have exported to about 20 countries across the world and it speaks volume that we have been competing against Baj Pio Mahendra all over TVs all over. Our biggest advantage of our product was visual acceptance as I say because it's a known fact that all over the world the best design free is bajads best design free is bajad so what we did was copied so if you have to copy try copy the best one so we copied baj and as you can see it is looking just like bajadaj but for this headlight light slightly different so that there is no copyright problem with anybody. The copyright problem does not happen at all. This is how it happened. Since we were manufacturing already manufacturing three wheelers, lot of people approached us all over and uh when electrical EV market started in India, some people approached us and wanted us to make an EV. At that time we were very happy making petrol and exporting and when we started when we decided okay we will do EV for you. We realize there are in EVs also there are there are certain categories like L3 and L5 L3 is a ricksha model that you see all over in north where it is more like a ricksha than an auto whereas ours was an auto. So what we did was we designed an specific L3. If you go go up a little, you'll find the picture also. You can see in the second slide which looks like a bajach old model bajach. This we made as an L3 model which was you know something for a customer or for anybody. The most important thing in life is promotion. Nobody wants a demotion. Everybody wants a promotion. So all the pedal richa people all over north happily went on to irrias but in south where pedal rickshas did were not existing uh people did not want to buy an Ishia because a drive auto driver doesn't want to drive a ricksha you want to drive an auto so we designed this L3 model which looks like an auto but is it passes the e-ria category what we say L3 I'll tell you people the difference between L3 L3 and L5 is not very big. In L3 the machine width cannot be more than 1 m. L5 is the normal auto that you see on roads. At that point of time the L5 specifications were not available with AI and IAT for approvals. So we have designed this picture what you are seeing this an L3 model which comes under the EIA category where the width is less is 1 m and the speed is not more than 25 30 kilometers. So this we have been selling in the south not acceptance even for the ricksha fellow as I said promotion is the root cause for everything. A rsha fellow will happily buy an L3 auto who which brand is Rani we call it Rani and he will not feel demoted. So this caught up everywhere but the market now is shifting towards L5. If you go to the next slide, you can see the L5 machine. What you have seen in the first slide also. This is the L5 machine which looks like a absolute baj auto. Other than the small lights we have exported to all the countries that you are seeing in that slide. UK, Japan, Nigeria, Ethopia, Egypt, Bellis, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Peru, Bles. So these are the countries we have exported already exported our they all these places were exporting our petrol models when we were running an EOU. We have sent EVs to Liberia, Tanzania, it good good amount of enquies are there but in exports where three wheelers as I said is the cheapest mode of commercial transport the most acceptable machine as a commercial machine for people's earnings but in which is very popular in Africa but the problem in Africa is there is no there is not enough power 24 hours to charge the batteries. So now I come to my product L3. I've already told you it is very popular all over not because it looks like an auto. It looks like auto doesn't look like a Yeah, hold this slide there my dear friend. We have got cargo models. We have got delivery vans and we have driveaway chi. This is all L3. What your pictures you are seeing is L3 and same can be got in L5 also here what happens people like you see lot of foots so drive away chi anything can be built all e-commerce companies want a delivery vans and e- loader is standard machines everybody uses so L3 is very popular but the future because of the slow speed government is not allowing them on the main roads and big cities big cities and on the main roads also they are all proposing L5. The machines that you see of Bajage, Mahindra, Pajio, PVS are all L5 models and they are our competition because all reputed companies are manufacturing products on 48 volts and so is our machine on 48 volts and we are giving an option of various op for for sale as a sales tool. We are giving lot of options where the customer can I mean uh before I go there let me make a few things. Our biggest advantage for our L5 product I will speak about the advantage of L5 product before I go into sales tools and all the biggest advantage of our L5 product is it is ripped all the spare part are interchangeable bajors. So every nook and corner India or for that matter world there are spare parts available there are mechanic available mechanics available because for an auto there should be zero downtime the the driver is a poor fellow he if he stops the machine he loses money so we have made sure that all components are same as bad so there is no problem with the spare parts or service and most important our machine is 100% Indian we have got nothing Chinese all other companies some companies I'm talking about the smaller companies major companies are anyway doing Indian so we are on par with them in quality and for quality I can tell you that since we have been competing against the major brands all over the world I mean that itself speaks volumes because we could compete with them because we were giving quality if you are not better than them, you're on par with them because end en\r\n",

         "95,62,72,82... BREAKING: Traoré & Erdoğan sign $5.2B Ankara deal; target 1.2M jobs across the Sahel\nSeptember 16, 2025 — In Ankara, Captain Ibrahim Traoré and President Erdoğan announced a $5.2B Ankara deal aimed at building a Turkey–Sahel industrial corridor $5.2B across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The agreement outlines rail/highway links, factories, and renewables with a Traoré–Erdoğan deal 1.2M jobs projection, shifting the Sahel from aid to industry. We break down the pillars (infrastructure, energy, industry, education), financing structure (including Islamic finance Musharaka Murabaha components), and what this means for regional power, trade routes, and sovereignty.

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nankara signs big s5.2b with traore\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:history. In the heart of Anchora, Ibrahim Trouore of Burkina Faso and Reab Taib Erdogan of Turkey signed a deal worth 5.2 billion. Not a loan dressed as charity, not an IMF package tied to gold or uranium, but a partnership agreement promising to generate 1.2 million jobs and establish what could become the largest industrial corridor in Africa. The announcement reverberated instantly, shaking both allies and critics alike. For decades, Africa has been offered development through contracts written in Washington, Paris, and London. Contracts that often left the continent poorer than before. But this moment felt different. Turkey, itself, a nation that straddles East and West, now emerges as a principal partner in Africa's bold new experiment. Factories, transport hubs, and trade corridors, not aid handouts, form the pillars of this agreement. Could this be the model of cooperation Africa has been waiting for? The numbers alone command attention. A $5.2 billion injection equals nearly 2.5% of Burkina Faso's entire GDP. The promise of 1.2 million jobs could reduce unemployment across the Sahel by double digits. Compare that to traditional aid packages measured in millions, not billions, that often evaporate into bureaucracy. And yet, beyond numbers lies symbolism. For the first time, an African leader is turning away from debt relief schemes and toward an industrial partnership rooted in production and sovereignty. Is this not the truest definition of independence? Predictably, the West reacted with unease. Commentators in London warned of geopolitical risks. Analysts in Washington described the deal as a strategic realignment. But on the streets of Wuagadugu, Bamako, and Name, the reaction was one of pride. Citizens saw not just a contract, but a statement that Africa's resources and labor can fuel African industries, not merely foreign stock markets. Could this be the moment the narrative shifts from Africa as deter to Africa as architect of its own destiny? The deal between Troure and Erdogan is more than numbers on paper. It is a challenge to old systems, a declaration that partnerships can be forged without chains and a warning that the global balance of power is shifting. But what does this mean for the wider world from Wall Street to Beijing? The $5.2 billion deal signed in Anchora is not just about railways, factories, or jobs. It is a political statement, loud, clear, and impossible to ignore. For the first time in decades, an African alliance has turned eastward, not to Moscow or Beijing, but to Ankora. Turkey, a NATO member, yet often at odds with Western capitals, has positioned itself as a bridge between continents. By investing in Africa's industrial corridor, Anchora signals its readiness to play a new role in the emerging multipolar world order. Could this be the opening chapter of Turkey as Africa's strategic partner? The implications are global. In Washington, analysts worry about losing influence in a region long treated as an aid dependent zone. In Brussels, concerns grow that Turkish African corridors could redirect trade flows worth billions of US dollars annually, bypassing European ports. Meanwhile, Beijing watches with caution, knowing that Ankara's bold move may complicate its own belt and road ambitions. If Africa can now choose between Washington, Beijing, and Ankara, does this not redefine the very map of global power? This agreement is more than economics. It is a symbol that Africa is no longer the silent subject of others strategies. It is becoming the stage where a new balance of power is rehearsed. But what exactly lies inside this deal that makes it so disruptive. The ink on the Ankora agreement was barely dry when its details began to circulate and they revealed not a loan trap, not a donation wrapped in conditions, but a blueprint for transformation. Unlike IMF contracts that mortgage natural resources, this deal was built on investment, infrastructure, and technology. It was a packact that spoke not of dependency, but of building capacity. At the heart of the agreement lies infrastructure. With a commitment of $2.8 8 billion. Turkey pledged to finance and construct highways linking Uaga Dugu, Bamako, and Name, a new regional railway system capable of moving both goods and people across borders and modern airports to open new corridors of trade. For the Sahel Alliance, long strangled by poor logistics. This was not just concrete and steel. It was freedom of movement. Could sovereignty truly exist without the power to move goods across one's own land? The second pillar is industry, backed by $1.4 $4 billion. Textile factories, agroprocessing hubs, and technology parks will be built aimed at keeping value added production inside Africa rather than exporting raw materials for pennies. For decades, cocoa from Ghana, cotton from Burkina Faso, and uranium from Niger have been shipped abroad, generating trillions in global markets while local farmers remained poor. This deal reverses the equation. Factories on African soil, jobs for African hands, and products stamped made in the Sahel. Is this not the essence of self-reliance? Energy forms the third pillar. With $800 million allocated, the deal prioritizes renewable power plants, solar grids, and crossber transmission lines. In a region where nearly 50% of the population still lacks access to electricity, this is more than infrastructure. It is justice. Energy is the bloodstream of modern economies and with it comes light for schools, power for hospitals, and fuel for industry. If Africa controls its own power, who can control Africa? Finally, health and education anchor the agreement. Though smaller in financial scale, $200 million, this investment may prove the most lasting. New hospitals, universities, and vocational training centers will rise, coupled with scholarships and teacher exchanges. Technology transfer is not just about machines. It is about minds. By insisting on knowledge transfer, Troué ensured that the deal was not a one-time transaction, but the seed of long-term independence. Can a continent that educates its own engineers and doctors ever again be told it is poor? Every clause of the Anara agreement reflects a philosophy, partnership instead of patronage, and every number tells a story. Billions invested not in resource extraction, but in roads, factories, grids, and schools. For the first time, Africa sees a contract that builds rather than bleeds. But the question remains, will these promises survive the test of implementation, or will they be met with the same resistance from global powers that fear a sovereign industrial Africa? Numbers tell a story, and here they speak louder than speeches. The Turkey Sahel agreement is set to generate 480,000 direct jobs and another 720,000 indirect jobs, reshaping the labor landscape of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. That is over 1.2 million livelihoods, a figure that dwarfs traditional aid projects, which rarely create more than a few thousand positions. For a region where youth unemployment has hovered around 30%, these jobs are not statistics. They are lifelines. Could this be the first time foreign investment empowers Africa's workers instead of exploiting them? Beyond jobs lies training, the cornerstone of true sovereignty, the deal includes programs to train 150,000 workers in technology and industry, from engineers in renewable energy to technicians in agrop processing. Even more groundbreaking, 25,000 management positions will be reserved for African professionals, ensuring that factories and projects are not just built in Africa, but run by Africans. This detail alone marks a radical departure from past contracts where decision-making often stayed in foreign hands. Is this not the definition of partnership rather than dependency? By combining employment with education, the agreement turns raw labor into skilled human capital, Africa's most undervalued resource. But the question lingers, how will this massive workforce reshape the Sahel's political and economic future? What makes Turkey different? Why did the Sahel Alliance trust Ankara when it has rejected contracts from Paris, Washington, and even Beijing? The answer lies in history, culture, and strategy. Unlike European powers, Turkey has no colonial past in Africa. There are no memories of resource plunder under a Turkish flag, no scars of forced treaties, no monuments to exploitation. This absence is not a weakness. It is Anchora's greatest advantage. In a continent where memory shapes politics, trust begins, where past wounds do not exist. Could this be why Anchora's arrival feels less like intrusion and more like partnership? Second, the bond of faith and culture runs deep in Mali, Niger, and Bkina Faso, nations where Islam is central to daily life. Turkey presents itself not as a foreign overseer, but as a fellow traveler. Shared traditions, familiar values, and religious solidarity, transform business deals into something more profound. Cooperation anchored in cultural respect. How often in Africa's dealings with the West has respect truly been part of the equation? Third, Turkeykey's technology and industry stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the West. From drones to construction, from textiles to renewable energy, Anchora has proven it can deliver cutting edge solutions without demanding political submission. A $5.2 billion package with built-in technology transfer signals, something the IMF never offered. Not just capital, but capability. When machines, factories, and skills remain in African hands, does that not redefine the meaning of independence? Finally, there is the principle of win-win. The Anchora deal does not mortgage gold or oil. It does not demand austerity or privatization. Instead, it channels billions into highways, factories, grids, and schools, projects that benefit both sides. Turkey gains markets and influence. Africa gains jobs, infrastructure, and dignity. This balance rare\r\n",

We at USIU Africa acknowledge the years of dedicated work of our graduates and take pride in their achievements. Amen. This is USIU's 47th graduation ceremony. Today, 1,519 graduates are graduating to join the growing ranks of our alumni. USIU already has more than 27,000 alumni who value their degrees and are putting them to work all over the world. True to our motto, education to take you places. I would like to call upon the alumni representative Mr. Isaiah Maliv to give his remarks. Isaiah graduated from USIU Africa with a degree in information systems and technology in 2011 and an executive MBA in 2014. He currently serves as the founding managing director and chief executive of Horizon Bank in South Sudan. He began his banking career with Stanic where he served for nearly a decade and rose to the position of country director at Stard Bank's Investment Arm Stan. He helped in co-founding Alpha Commercial Bank before moving to Australia where he worked with A&Z Bank in Melbourne as a senior service specialist in institutional banking. He serves on the governing council of South Sudan Bankers Association and serves as a non-executive director of South Sudan Institute of Banking and Finance. He is a proud alumnus of USIU Africa and is currently pursuing a doctor of business administration at Eton Business School in Dubai. Please join me in welcoming Mr. Maliv. Uh the chief guest and chancellor, ambassador Dennis Aari, board of trustee, university council, uh management board, university senate, faculty, students, staff and alumni present Parents and guardians rather parents and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentlemen and the greeting class of 2025. It is a a deep honor to stand before you today not only as your guest speaker but also as a proud alumnest of this university. USIU gave me more than a degree. It gave me the courage to dream, the discipline to lead and the vision to serve. I first sat in this gradation square when I graduated with my bachelor degree in 2011 and later earned my executive MBA in 2014. To be here now celebrating your moment truly feels like a full cycle experience. Like many of you today, I once sat where you are, excited, hopeful, and perhaps a little uncertain about what lay ahead. My career began in 2009 while still a student here as an intern at Stanic Bank in Churomo Westlands. I wasn't given glamorous task. I filed documents, spool data from the data store and ran erands. At first, I wondered if this was really what I had studied for. But in carrying out those small task, I discovered a timeless truth. Greatness is born out of small beginnings. After graduation, I joined Stanic Bank South Sudan where I spent nearly a decade eventually becoming country head of Standib, the asset management arm of Standard Bank and Liberty Group of South Africa. Those years shaped me as a leader and taught me the value of patience, persistence and resilience. Later together with colleagues, we co-ounded Alpha Commercial Banks in South Sudan. Building a bank from scratch was tough, but it reinforced an important truth. Leadership is not about preserving what already exist. It's about daring to keep what does not yet exist. My journey then took me overseas to Australia where I worked with A&Z Bank, the leading bank in Asia Pacific. There I experienced world-class banking, high standards and a culture of excellence. That opportunity gave me confidence that education can place you on the global stage. Yet, it also reminded me of something vital. Global exposure only has value if it translate into local impact. That realization brought me back home. I returned to South Sudan to help establish Horizon Bank, an institution built not only to provide financial services, but also to contribute to nation building in a fragile economy. Every account open and every loan dispersed is more than a transaction. It is a step towards building trust, creating opportunity and strengthening resilience. Through all these stages, one truth has guided me. Education has been my passport. My first degree at USIU opened the door to my career. My executive MBA shape sharpened my leadership and strategic thinking. In 2015, I pursued a business economic leadership course at Stalin Bush University in South Africa, which strengthened my capacity to lead with vision in complex environment. And today, as I pursue my doctorate of business administration, I am researching how fragile economies can build resilient banking systems to drive sustainable growth. Nelson Mandela said, \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.\" He is what echo through my journey and they align perfectly with the promise of this university. Education to take you places. Indeed, education has taken me from the lecture halls of USIU to boardrooms across Africa and beyond. And now it will take each of you to places you may not yet imagine. For my journey, I leave you with three lessons. One, resilience is a mindset. The obstacles you encounter are not barriers. They are stepping stones. Number two, education is lifelong. Graduation is not the end of learning. It is the beginning of a journey that will keep unlocking new opportunities. Leadership is service. Titles and pos and positions may change, may fade rather, but the institution you built, the people you have lived and the impact you leave behind will endure. Class of 2025, resilience is the bridge between your dream and your destiny. Your USIU education can take you anywhere from Safari Park to Juba, from Nairobi to Melbourne, from lecture halls to boardrooms. But truth success will not be measured by how far you go. It will be measured by how much you give back, by the lives you touch, and by the institution you help build. And so today, that responsibility and that opportunity rest in your hands. Use it boldly, use it wisely, and use it to create a future worthy of your dreams. I am proud to be a double alumnus of USIU. And today, I'm even prouder of each of you. Congratulation, class of 2025. [Applause] The future is not waiting for you. The future is waiting on you. Best of luck as you step out into the world. May you carry with you the courage to dream big, the resilience to overcome challenges, and the wisdom to make a difference. Go forth with confidence and conquer new horizons. The world is waiting for your impact. Best of luck in all your future endeavors. God bless you. As I end my speech, I uh I I didn't I hadn't uh uh you know introduce my dear wife. She's seated here. Her name is Dr. Chuty. Dr. Chuty is a medical doctor. She's a pediatrician doctor and she currently uh works at Gate Children Hospital. And both of us are from South Sudan. And thank you very much, professor, for the kind introduction. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Thank you, Mr. Maliv. Our validictorian this year is Runak Vinodri Solani. [Applause] Runak is a Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Technology graduate. He hails from Tanzania and earned the highest academic achievement with a GPA of 3.966. [Applause] Let's cheer him up. 3.966 on a scale of four. The chief guest, Ambassador Dennis Aari, Board of Trustees, University Council, Management Board, University Senate, faculty, students, staff, and alumni present, parents, and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, and the graduating class of 2025. Good morning. When I was a child, I used to imagine graduation as a single shining moment. Walking across a stage, wearing a gown, receiving a degree, and smiling for the cameras. But now that we are here, I realize graduation is not just a moment. It is a patchwork. It is built from countless small sacrifices, sleepless nights, fears conquered, friendships made, and lessons learned. Each of us carries our our own unique pieces and together they formed a beautiful picture that is the class of 2025. A week ago I received an email from the university. It was short but its message carried enormous weight. I was selected as this year's validictorian. For a moment I froze. Along with the joy came a deep sense of fear because I had only one and a half days to write this speech. I thought to myself, what can I possibly say that is worthy of this honor? And then I smiled because I realized that I've not been preparing for this speech on paper. I've been preparing for it throughout my entire journey here. Every late night, every exam, every friendship formed, and every hardship endured has been a rehearsal for this moment. Three years ago, I earned my first 4.0 GPA. [Applause] And some of my friends teased me saying, \"Here comes the future valadictorian.\" At the time, it felt like a joke, but it planted a seed in me. We will laugh and even playfully reass what I might say. Quietly I told myself, \"Yes, I want this. I'll work for this. And one day, I'll stand on the graduation square.\" And now here I am. [Applause] But this stage, this microphone, this honor, it is not just about me. It is about us. It is about the graduating class of 2025 and the remarkable journey we have all walked together. We survived the chaos of group projects where one person carried the weight while another's greatest effort was signing the cover page. Those moments taught us patience, resilience, and maybe even forgiveness. We wrestled with term papers stretching 10, 12, even 15 pages, navigating endless citations, formatting rules, and safe assign reports. We refreshed with pounding hearts. And now even this very speech must pass through safe assign. Prove that diligence has been our constant companion all the way to graduation. We ended the notorious responders browser where even a glance away felt like a crime. And yes, we remember the professors who promised the exams will be easy only for the questions to feel like they came from another universe. And who can forget our first days in the library, piling books as if we read them all, only to return most of them untouched at Sinister's end. still pristine but a symbol of the ambition we carried. And then there were the lighter almost humorous companions along the way. Who among us will forget those late nights when desperate for help we turned to chat GPT. [Applause] Whether it was brainstorming essays, revising drafts, or simply reminding us that we were not alone in our struggle, it became our unofficial classmate. The one who never missed the deadline, never said no and never judged our panic at 2:00 a.m. These experiences, some frustrating and some funny, remind us of a deeper truth. Our story as graduates is not of the individual victory but of shared survival, shared resilience and shared growth. Yet I must pause here and ask a question that weighs deeply on my heart. What if the person most deserving of the title validictorian never received it? What if the true validictorian is not standing on this stage but those quietly seated as seated among us today? If I could share this honor, I would give it to the student who stayed up after long shifts just to finish an assignment. To the one who typed essays on a cracked phone screen or borrowed old laptop that froze every few minutes. To the classmate who sold handmade crafts, food or anything they could just to cover fees. To those who rose before down, squeezed into overcrowded buses, walked miles under scorching heat or pouring rain, yet still made it to class with determination. [Applause] I'll recognize the students who studied with heavy hearts, carrying grief or personal struggles, yet refusing to give up. those who were not just students but also providers juggling school work with the responsibility of putting food on the table. Those who sometimes stumbled on a test not out of neglect but because of hunger or exhaustion acclaimed the night before. They may not hold this title but they hold my deepest respect. There are classmates here who had to be their own families. Students who lost a parent or both parents during their studies. Students who raised younger siblings making decisions no one their age should ever have to make. Their perseverance humbles us. And then there are the unsung heroes behind every graduate here. The single parents who worked multiple jobs to keep their children in school. The grandparents The grandparents who became both guardians and providers. The migrant workers who missed birthdays, graduations, and milestones, sending money from far away so that their sons and daughters could have a better future. the families who never wore caps and gowns themselves, but made sure we would. [Applause] I also know that for many of us, the cap and gown we wear today will not remain on our heads for long. After the ceremony, many graduates will take them off and hand them to the very people who made this moment possible. The parents, the guardians, and loved ones who supported us every step of the way. In doing so, we acknowledge that this achievement is not ours only. It is a shared victory, a symbol of sacrifices, their love, and the unwavering belief in our potential. Before I conclude, allow me to honor the many hands and hearts behind this moment. To the parents and guardians, thank you for your sacrifices, your faith, and your unconditional love. To those watching from afar, you are with us in spirit. To those remembered only in memory, your legacy carries us forward. To our professors, mentors, janitors, guards, and staff, thank you for your service. Often unseen, but always felt. Today we close one chapter, but we are not closing the book. The work the world outside the this gates is waiting not just for our knowledge but for our courage our compassion and our creativity. And as we step forward let us remember that sometimes the greatest victory is not in standing here as valadictorian but in refusing to sink despite the waves. Persistence not perfection is the true measure of success. The degrees we hold are not simply certificates of education. their responsibilities to lead with integrity, to innovate with purpose, and to serve with humility. As Denel Washington wisely said, if you don't fail, you're not truly trying. I'll repeat, if you don't fail, you're not truly trying. To achieve what we have never done, we to achieve what we have never had, we must dare to do what we have never done. to take risks, to embrace challenges, and to rise even when the odds are stacked against us. Congratulations, class of 2025. We have reached the summit. But let us never forget that we did not climb alone. This moment belongs not only to us as graduates, but also to the parents, guardians, and families and loved ones who carried us here. And so as we close, there is only one fitting tribute, a standing ovation for them, for us. Class of 2025, let's rise and applaud. [Applause] Thank you very much. Thank you for inspiring your colleagues with your speech and academic performance. No doubt you are a cultivated role model serving deserving emulation by your colleagues and all students. I will now call upon the vice chancellor professor Menda interangui to give his remarks. Professor Man Tarangui is the vice chancellor of USIU Africa. He is a scholar, a teacher, researcher and administration of international reput whose experience and expertise span three decades and cut across diverse geographical locations and institutions. Trained in language education at Kenyata University and cultural anthropology at the University of Illinois.

Professor Interangu's teaching and administrative experiences include serving as faculty at St. Lawrence University, Agastana College, Calvin College in the US, Kenyata University, Egaton University and the chief executive officer at the commission for university education Kenya and as the deputy principal in charge of academics, research and student affairs at the National Intelligence and Research University College. Professor Interangui is supporting and elevating the USIU Africa's mission to prepare the next generation of effective, engaged and ethical leaders for the fastch changing Africa and global context. I thought you would clap for me. Good morning. Our chief guest, Ambassador Dennis Aari, who also is our chancellor, the chair, board of trustees, Professor Eileen Wilson Oeleran, members of the board of trustees, the chair of the university council, Mr. Paul Casimu, members of the university council, management board, university senate, faculty, students, staff, and alumni present, parents and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, and our very very very important guests, the class of 2025. Five. Good morning. Allow me to mention that we appreciate our guests that are here. Those ones who have not mentioned including the chair of my former employer commission for university education. several VCs who have come to support us, ambassadors and government representatives, secretary general of Cupet, Mastercard Foundation colleagues, diplomats, CEOs and directors and governor of Narok County. Welcome to the best university in Africa. Today we look at the journey we have taken as an institution as you've heard and we marvel at the strides we've made towards providing access quality and relevant education to our students. When we held our first graduation in 1979 there were just 29 graduates. 29 Today we celebrate 1,519, our largest cohort ever. This is our 47th commencement and our 56th year of existence. 56 years ago when USIU was born, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made history by becoming the first humans to land on the moon. And 47 years ago, legendary longd distanceance runner Henry Renault broke four world records within 81 days. the 3,000 m stipes, 10,000 m, 5,000, and 3,000 m flat. Why do I say this? We saw what our ladies did in Tokyo. And I also I say what we are doing in the education space. We keep charting the path for new ways to do things. Among you for instance are the first graduates of BSc in data science and analytics, bachelor of science in software engineering, bachelor of science in applied biochemistry and bachelor of global leadership and governance. In addition, we also are graduating the very first class of doctoral students in information systems and technology and this time they are all women. [Applause] Let me share a few highlights of the things that we have also been doing. We welcomed our first bachelor of nursing students. We launched a bachelor of science in artificial intelligence and robotics. Master of science in data science and analytics which is offered online and a master of science in clinical pharmacology and the therapeutics. These programs, ladies and gentlemen, are designed to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and experience needed for today's world. And that is why, for instance, we have integrated virtual reality into clinical training, giving our students real world experience before they step into their professional placements. Our faculty and students continue to excel in research and innovation. Last year, our faculty produced 136 publications in high impact journals and secured a nearly $900,000 US in new grants. Our own professor Naomi Noah got national recognition as the best female researcher in applied sciences by the national research foundation. Six undergraduate students in the school of pharmacy and health sciences authored publications with Samuel Ishutiara, a fifth year student publishing nine papers which led him to travel recently to Denmark to present one of his works at the 83rd World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Reflecting on this international experience, Samuel says, and I quote, I shared findings from my research poster on integrating artificial intelligence and tele medicine for management of HIV associated neurological disorders. The experience increased my confidence in research presentations and showed me how student research can contribute to global health innovation. Congratulations students of media and communication won at the global PR boot camp. Those in science and technology presented research in China, developed AI solutions for disability inclusion and ranked third in Africa in NASA's space apps challenge. Hospitality students took place took first place at the future leaders challenge while others won gold, silver, bronze medals for innovations in SDG competitions, securing participation in the SDG Olympia 2025 in Geneva. This year, our students from international relations and international business administration came second in the Lady Joyce Alo International annual alternative dispute resolution mood competition 2025. These achievements, ladies and gentlemen, show that USIU Africa students are competing and winning on the global stage because we are training them to be agile and relevant in this everchanging world. Excellence at USIU Africa is not about academics only. We are committed to producing well-rounded students. Our counseling center continues to provide psychosocial support. Our placement and career services team has expanded employer engagement including a mean career fair that will bring employees employers to our campus on 8th and 9th October. We already have 13 employers confirmed. Graduating class, take note. Our financial aid program grew by 22% this year, allowing us to support nearly 600 students. Students from various academic programs have also participated in our partnership with Langata Women's Prison through the State Department for Correctional Services, bringing skills and knowledge to those of us inside the prison. The university has distinguished itself as the most inclusive high education institution in the region and has postal support for people living with disabilities. At USIU Africa, we are not just diverse, we live it every day. Our sports teams have upheld our pride and heritage, demonstrating resilience and teamwork. The women's 3x3 basketball team won regional competitions and represented Africa in the global championships in China. The men's and women's hockey teams represented the East African community in the Africa club championships in Egypt. The rugby team won the East Africa Varsity Cup and USIU was ranked second out of 39 universities in the East African University Championships, bringing home 49 medals. So, class of 2025, today you live with more than just a degree. You carry with you these qualities of innovation, agility, competition, service, resilience and the vi and the vision that defines our dear USIU Africa. Keep learning, keep questioning and keep creating solutions for a world not yet imagined. The world awaits you. Step into your role and be a leader who thinks critically, adapts swiftly, and acts ethically because that is who we've prepared you to become. Class of 2025, go forth, discover, learn, and serve. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you, Professor Interagu, for your remarks and encouraging words. Let's give him another round of applause. It is now my great honor, Ed privilege to welcome our chief guest for today. Our chief guest during this 47th graduation ceremony is Ambassador Dennis Awari. Chancellor at the United States International University Africa. Ambassador Aurori is a distinguished leader, seasoned diplomat and accomplished business executive with extensive experience across multiple sectors including mobility, healthcare, renewable energy, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, banking and technical education. His dynamic career spans over four decades, prominently across East Africa and the broader African continent, demonstrating a stefast commitment in innovation, strategic leadership, and sustainable growth. Welcome, Ambassador Aurori. [Applause] The chair of the board of trustees, Professor Eileen. Members of the board of trustees, the chair of the university council, the Paul Casimu, members of the university council, the vice chancellor, Professor Mendan Tarangui, management board, university senate, faculty, students, staff and alumni present, parents and guardians, distinguished ladies and gentle Gentlemen, and most importantly, the graduating class of 2025. Good morning. It is both an honor and a privilege to welcome you to our 47th commencement ceremony, the most significant event in our university calendar for our students. Today we celebrate not only your academic achievements class of 2025 but also your remarkable journey of discovery. This occasion holds a very special meaning for me as it marks my very first commencement ceremony as chancellor of USIU Africa. In the months since my installation, I have learned a great deal about USIU Africa and all of it has thoroughly impressed me and I am humbled by the trust placed in me to serve this great institution and I'm also deeply grateful to share this milestone with you today. I would like to extend a warm welcome and warm and sincere welcome to the distinguished members of the board of trustees and the university council present here today. These remarkable professionals dedicate their expertise, time and wisdom to ensuring the continued success and growth of our beloved institution. Their contributions are an integral part of our collective achievements and we look forward to continuing this journey with them into the future together. To the graduating class of 2025, what a joy it is to witness the culmination of your years of hard work, resilience, and dedication as so aptly described by your validictorian. Your journey has been supported by your professors, mentors, families, and friends. All of whom believed in your potential. Today, we celebrate them as much as we celebrate you. During your time here, you discovered far more than academic knowledge. You discovered new passions, sharpened your talents, and built friendships that will last a lifetime. Among you, as we've just heard, are pioneers in emerging fields. Of great interest to me are the field is the field of sustainability and ESG. You represent a bold response to the most urgent challenges of our of our time. Climate change, environmental degradation, ethical governance, and social equity. Your education has not only equipped you with critical knowledge to tackle these challenges but also instilled a sense of responsibility to play a role in leading Africa, Kenya and the world towards a more just, inclusive and sustainable future. In today's interconnected world, sustainability and ESG are no longer optional. They are the new language of business, governance, and society. Companies and institutions are increasingly judged not just by profit margins. Very important. But not just by profit margins alone, but by their environmental stewardship, social impact, and governance standards. The world is demanding transparency, accountability, and responsibility. You, the class of 2025, step out equipped to participate in turning these global expectations into homegrown solutions that match profitability with purpose. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is transforming how we think and work. As students of USIU Africa, you have learned not to fear AI, but to harness it. AI is not a replacement for human creativity. Instead, it is an accelerator. It can process vast amounts of data, reveal hidden patterns, and automate routine and repetitive tasks. But it cannot replace empathy, wisdom or the human spirit. The leaders of tomorrow, I should say the leaders of today, you will be those who combine the power of these new technologies with ethical decision making and a deep sense of responsibility to society. Some of you explored entrepreneurship through our innovation and incubation center, turning ideas into ventures to serve communities. This puts you firmly on the road to self employment and becoming employers, people who are much needed in our world today. Yet others discovered the balance and teamwork through sports, clubs, and the arts. I saw this firsthand during our inaugural half marathon in July where the power of unity and community came alive to raise funds for the less fortunate among us to be able to join our university. This year's theme of journey of discovery captures the very essence of your USIU Africa experience. You came here with dreams and you leave today not just with degrees but with critical thinking, creativity and ethical leadership. qualities that cannot be replaced by technology, not even by AI at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. These are the skills that will allow you to lead in uncertain times, to adapt quickly, and to make a difference wherever you go. A long time ago, as a young graduate beginning my voyage of discovery, I set out to make a visible impact on every task or job that I undertook with and within a set time by becoming a a a full-time change agent. I implore you to do the same. Being one will help you develop your leadership skills, enhance your career prospects, build networks, foster innovation, and lift your image within your chosen field and beyond. It has worked for me. I haven't always succeeded, but it has worked for me and for many others, and it will work for you, too. Graduation, as you have heard, is not the end of your discovery. It is the beginning of a new chapter. From this day forward, let curiosity guide you. Let courage fuel you and let integrity anchor you. Approach every opportunity and every challenge with the same openness and determination that brought you success here. And remember, as you step out into the world, you do not...",

         "The World Bank's BIG LIE about Nigeria's Economy! (You Need to Hear This)",
         "In this video, we break down the latest praise from the World Bank for President Tinubu's economic reforms. But is this praise justified? A political commentator from Arise News and a fellow content creator argue that the reforms, while praised internationally, are actually causing more hardship for the average Nigerian. They discuss the lack of tangible benefits from the subsidy removal, the continued borrowing, and the truth behind diplomatic statements from organizations like the World Bank.\n​#Nigeria ​#NigerianPolitics ​#Tinubu​#WorldBank ​#SubsidyRemoval​#AtikuAbubakar ​#GoodluckJonathan\n​#AriseNews ​#EconomicReforms​#PoliticalCommentary ​#NigeriaDecides​#APC ​#PDP ​#2027Elections​#NigerianEconomy​#PoliticalWarfare​#TrendingNigeria\nKINDLY SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE POLITICAL UPDATES\nLIKE\nCOMMENT\nSHARE\nSUBSCRIBE",
         "Тексты с изображений\r\nthe world bank*s big че they*re not helping you!)\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:The World Bank can praise Nigerian leader and say the reforms are working here and everything. What do you want the World Bank to say? Is that not what they've always said? Is that not what the Breton institutions always want? They want reforms that will stifle the lives of people. They don't care about the people. What they care about is yes, they lend out the loans to the development partners and the countries involved. And those loans go ahead to hurt those countries in the end and hurt the economy with all sorts of reforms. So they've always pushed for liberalization in the forex market. They got it. They've always pushed for subsidy remover. They got it. But it is us in Nigeria that now know that the World Bank was not correct because this same subsidy remover that the World Bank was going to free up cash for development. We are still now borrowing for development. Till today we can't account for the cash. Some part of the cash that subsidy has freed up is the cash that we are now pling into servicing loans. It's a fact there despite the fact that the government say okay some of the cash they've deployed in some roads but part of that money to is also pushed towards loans. So the question is what was the benefit in the end of removing the subsidies? It brought about hardship but what was the reinvestment in the lives of the people? Next to nothing. There's not been cushioning of the effect of this pain and suffering. All the things President Inobu promised oh agricultural expansion loans for businesses and all of that. It's not been far reaching enough. And that's why when you look at it people are still complaining. a lawyer now has not summoned them via FOI to provide the 8 something million people they said they giving conditional cash for 25,000 we would like to see the number because if you give that money at least we should be able to feel it in the state of of the economy but we can't feel it and it also goes to the conversation about the world bank is they having and they're talking about the fact that yes oh h the the renewed hope um program what initiative I want to do all these things are good but you see there's a difference between announcement and implementation somebody sent me a message yesterday Giovanni Williams about how development bank of Nigeria how they went through the court of development bank in 2019 they said they have money for them till today they have not given them the money so there's a lot of audio announcement till today this government has not investigated what happened in the humanitarian ministry in the last administration under madame far how they were sharing money for people in the hands during covid and they call cash transfer so there are many things it's not just announcement we need to be able to see the implementation and as regards the oil sector it shows people are diverting to the deeper waters but my very good friend and brother says I should wrap up so I wrap Are you the floor? All right, are are you saying the poor countries can never repay their loans? Senator, are are you saying that you're opposed to debt relief for impoverished countries? Yes. No, we should forgive the debts, but that's not going to help those countries very much. Okay. What will tax cuts? Some African tax rates are the highest in the world. In Tanzania, the 30% rate kicks in at $475 of income. Plus, they have a 20% value added tax that gets added to everything you buy. those those high tax rates make it impossible to build capital in those countries. So nothing gets built, not not factories, not roads, not anything. Poor African countries have the lowest wage workers in the world. And yet a company like Nike, for instance, can't can't put a factory in one of those countries because of the oppressive tax rates. Taxes have killed any possibility of economic development. They killed any hope of these countries ever helping themselves, helping themselves. And which that and that leaves them completely at the mercy of charity and loans. And here here's the worst part. You know why those countries have such high tax rates? Because of us to show us that they can raise enough money to pay back their loans, but taxes can't raise any money if they kill the economies. So it turns out that the the tragic unintended consequence of our good our good intentions toward Africa, our kindness, is that we have encouraged those countries to lock themselves into a gruesome economic depression. If we don't urge those countries to cut their tax rates, they will never grow their economies. People will live lifetimes of unemployment. Disease will be rampant. Poverty will be permanent. And children will be hungry. And our charity will never be enough. Never. You see political tensions boy knows that the force in 2027. He himself know the force. Even he is a political grandmaster political strategist. He have he is panic is serious panic in Tobu himself knows you can't he can't deny it and he can't even stand the force in 2027. All effort is to dislodge him from Assur. That is it. Anyways, you know a lot of things are going on. Political leaders are meeting here and there. ADC having their meetings. They are still talking about going through primaries and whoever wins a marriage at that primaries they are all going to support him. A lot of visit here and there. All the political leaders meetings Jonathan we don't know what he's playing at yet. There is still time for all this for them to do everything because everything we are all saying today is still speculations. We are still speculating. Could it be this? Could it be that? Is this one running? Is that one running? Where is it? Which platform is this person running? Is Jonathan on the race? Yes or no? Or is still room speculations because they have not come officially? They have not issued statement officially for us to know for people to know where they stand. Do you understand? And every little meeting you see now is some even if it just personal meetings just to still people will say generalize is politics they are still discussing politics even if they do not even talk about politics in that meetings but hey it is a political season the planning starts now anyways take your time listen to this video as for what bank listen to what he said that's why I like this this man you tell them this truth is bitter but you have to say it the way it is take your time listen to this video we'll come back and talk about it. Don't forget to leave your honest opinion, like, share, comment, and subscribe to this YouTube channel so that you get to see updates like this. Do you understand? Thank you very much. You had you know, President Good Luck Jonathan uh visiting the same senator David M whose uh position as chairman of the party, the ADC has been approved by even if there is a group within the ADC that is objecting to that. Now it's of interest to the extent that one uh in the case of uh Adamawa he disclosed that oh they they met to discuss uh something of interest to the Nigerian people and that we address how the oligarchs in Nigeria are punishing the poor people. So in that regard the disclosure uh was made in that direction but as for president Jonathan people were saying oh okay he's now doing consultations with a lot of people. Well, the reason why many uh commentators would say that was that after President Jonathan left office, he set up the Glo Jonathan Foundation and then he he was very busy with international engagements. Uh he wasn't so actively seen having political meetings. But in recent times, we've seen him having meetings with Mr. Peter B, General Abanga, um uh Governor Baral Muhammad of Bouchi state and then now he was seen publicly going to visit uh Senator David M. He may have visited people previously but you know it didn't generate news but it gets reported now because of the circumstances uh surrounding his uh uh uh his place in the current politics with a lot of people saying that oh he's probably the best uh person uh that can take power away from the APC government and return it to whatever party. But all of that is still at the level of people speculating and trying to do their own permutations. President Jonathan himself has not made any uh any statement as to where he stands. uh it could just well be you know uh uh you know that that he has returned to active politics without necessarily being interested in any position. So we should wait for him uh and not speculate uh for him to come forward and tell us. After all in 2023 some persons went and spent spent 150 million NRA to collect funds on his behalf. At the end of the day uh he said he was not interested. So I think the owners rest with him uh to give clarity. But what we can say is that with all these meetings, with all these consultations, that something is happening that the opposition coalition is coming together trying to find direction. And it is of interest that Malami Abdullah also said yesterday that those members of the coalition who have not made up their minds should go and resign their membership of other political parties and join the opposition coalition under the umbrella of ADC to form a formidable front. By the same token, he said that uh the involvement with ADA, the other political party called ADA has been laid to rest because ADA was supposed to be the backup, you know, uh uh platform just in case the ADC platform uh proved ineffectual. Uh so we watch developments and I think we'll have clarity one way or the other uh by the first quarter of next year. Now the World Bank chief, new World Bank chief in Nigeria, Dr. Veggis meeting with the minister of national planning and budget and national planning. First, he commended Nigeria's economic reform. He says we are on track. Now that has become very characteristic for World Bank. Every time they are prisoning the Chinub administration that the reforms are well. I assume that World Bank will also be diplo\r\n",

When you want to HELP YOURSELF, you tell them what they want to hear\"\nMy fellow citizens, let us ALLOW LEADERSHIP TO EMERGE by standing on fundamental Fresh-starts, delivering a transformational vision of TRUTH to EVERYONE.\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nIt means, politicians should STOP playing games with the lives of the people of Zambia, and that citizens should come to an understanding that we can't change what we are unwilling to face. Simply put - we must ALL look straight into the mirror and say 'here we are, it is what it is'\nBottom line: We must be HONEST of WHERE WE ARE as a nation, HOW WE GOT HERE and HOW WE CAN GET OUT OF THIS PLACE\nWHERE ARE WE? : We are in a more dangerous place today than we were yesterday or last week or last month or last year or in 2021, or a dozen years ago. Everything that shouldn't be normal has been normalized. Everything that shouldn't go wrong is going wrong. We are no longer at the centre of everything Africa is doing right. We are in a place where SAVING our country is undoubtedly the most imperative task of our time.\nHOW DID WE GET HERE?\nFirst of all, you will agree with me that the most logical thing to do if you discover that you are riding a DEAD HORSE 🐴, is to immediately dismount!\nSTRANGELY, THIS HAS BEEN OUR FOCUS AS A NATION REGARDING THE DEAD HORSE\n1. BUYING A STRONGER WHIP ( suggesting that maybe we JUST need a millitary government, one that is tough, with a no nonsense President_😉)\n2. MERE CHANGING OF RIDERS ( We have changed Presidents, probably the most in the SADC region, we are at number 7 as of today, yet reality is that the more we change, the worse our lives turn out to be_😉)\n3. APPOINTING A COMMITTEE TO STUDY A DEAD HORSE ( Have instituted numerous commissions of enquiry to come up with reasons why our country ranks high regarding misappropriation of funds by public servants.

'GDP or GNP can't grow to such and such figures in a given period' 😀)\n6. *RE- DEFINING OR RE- CLASSIFYING THE DEAD HORSE as 'LIVING IMPAIRED' ( Failing to admit that the System of governance is not helping an ordinary citizen, but convincing ourselves that since it was adopted from a developed country, it is must be the right one for us 😀)\n7.

FOREIGNERS TO RIDE THE DEAD HORSE ( Convincing ourselves that we need foreigners to come and help us handle our debts, we also need foreigners to construct our roads, schools, hospitals, houses, shops, make blocks for us, even produce and cook our food 😌)\n8.

For years, America thought it had the monopoly on influence, the money, the muscle, the connections. But India, oh, India just showed up in Africa like a master chess player and made a move that has Washington scratching its head. This ain't just about trade deals. It's about respect. It's about positioning. It's about rewriting the future of global power. And tonight I'm going to break down exactly how India used Africa to outsmart America. Let's dive in. Africa is no longer the forgotten continent in global strategy. It is the stage where the future of power will be decided. For decades, world leaders dismissed Africa as a place of instability, poverty or aid dependency. But if you look closely, you'll see what India saw. A gold mine of opportunity. Not just in terms of natural resources like oil, gas, and rare earth metals, but in its people. Africa is home to the fastest growing population on Earth with a youth demographic larger than any other continent. That's not a burden. That's a workforce, an innovation engine, a consumer base waiting to rise. And when you have a continent filled with raw resources and young minds, whoever earns its trust and builds strong ties today will own the future tomorrow. See, America has long approached Africa with a colonial hangover, treating it as a recipient of aid, a pawn in bigger geopolitical battles or simply as a marketplace for Western products. But India looked at the chessboard differently. India saw Africa not as a charity case but as a partner in progress. That single shift in mindset changes everything. Because when you treat someone as an equal, when you come in with respect and not superiority, you plant the seeds of loyalty that no amount of money can buy. Now, let's talk about the geography and strategy behind it. Africa sits at the crossroads of some of the world's most important shipping lanes. From the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, controlling relationships in Africa means controlling trade routes that connect the East and West. India being historically connected to Africa through centuries of trade and migration already has cultural and human bridges that America doesn't. Indian businesses didn't just show up yesterday. They've been investing in Africa's healthcare and energy for decades. And those long-term commitments, they're paying off right now. While Washington debates budgets and lectures African leaders on democracy, India is building railroads, laying internet cables, training doctors, and setting up solar projects. You think African nations don't notice that? Of course they do. They see who's there to empower and who's there to control. And slowly those hearts and minds shift away from the west and toward New Delhi. This is what makes Africa the new chess board. Every piece on this board, every port, every contract, every diplomatic handshake matters. Endshake matters. And India is moving like a grandmaster, thinking five steps ahead. They're not just making deals, they're securing influence. They're not just selling products. They're shaping futures. America, it still plays checkers assuming brute force or big checks will win the day. But in Africa, that arrogance is backfiring. What we're witnessing is the opening act of a global game where Africa is no longer the background. It is the prize. And India, it just positioned itself as the player who understands the board better than anyone else. For decades, Africa has been treated like a patient in the hospital of global politics. Weak, dependent, waiting for aid packages from the West. America and its allies rolled in with their billions. But those billions always came with fine print. To this, vote that way. Follow our rules. Accept our oversight. Aid became a leash and that leash became resentment. African leaders smiled at the photo ops. But deep down they knew the truth. They weren't being treated as equals. They were being managed. India saw that weakness in America's approach and said, \"Nah, we're not playing that game.\" Instead of aid, India came with something far more powerful. Partnership. But in the m, not pity, not handouts, not lectures. India said, \"Let's build together.\" That's why today you see Indian companies constructing roads in Kenya, laying fiber optic cables in Nigeria and helping with renewable energy projects in Ethiopia. These aren't charity projects. These are investments. When you invest, both sides win. When you give aid with strings, only one side wins and the other side knows it. Think about the psychology here. If I give you money with a list of conditions, you're always looking for a way out of the deep. But if I build a factory with you, if I train your engineers, if I partner with your farmers, you don't just owe me, you trust me. That's the difference between dependency and partnership. And that's exactly the card India played. America still doesn't get Washington wants control, not collaboration. But India understood the power of humility. It approached Africa saying, \"We were colonized, too. We know what it feels like to be underestimated, exploited, written off. Let's rise together. That message hits differently in Africa than America's will help you, but only if you behave. And here's the kicker. This partnership approach isn't just winning friends. It's building long-term influence. When you put down roots in education, infrastructure, and technology, you create ties that no amount of American aid can compete with. A student in Ghana trained by an Indian university will remember who gave him that chance. A community in Tanzania lit up by Indian solar grids won't forget who helped them move from darkness to light. India's smart play is simple but profound. Stop treating Africa like a child and start treating it like a partner. That shift alone changes the balance of global power. Because in the 21st century, influence doesn't come from who gives the biggest check. It comes from who earns the most respect. And right now in Africa, America is writing checks. But India is cashing in trust. So the question isn't whether India outsmarted America. The real question is how long will it take for Washington to realize the game has changed because Africa has made it clear it doesn't want aid. It wants allies and India just became the ally of choice. Quiet revolutions are the most dangerous ones because they grow in silence in the shadows while the big powers are distracted. That's exactly what's happening with bricks. For years, Washington laughed at it. Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, a bunch of countries with different problems, different goals, and supposedly no chance of competing with the mighty G7. But while America laughed, bricks built brick by brick, deal by deal, it became the silent revolution that is now shaking the foundation of the global system. And here's where Africa comes in. Africa isn't just a side story to bricks. It's the bridge. India being one of the key voices inside bricks recognized that Africa could supercharge the group's legitimacy and reach. If BRICS was going to be more than just a talk shop, it needed new blood, new partners, and new markets. Enter Africa, a continent hungry for investment, desperate for allies that don't treat it as secondass, and ready to rewrite its own story. India understood this better than most. China already poured billions into African infrastructure, but often with predatory debt traps. The West offered aid, but with arrogance attached. India's play was subtler. It positioned itself as the friendly face of bricks, the partner that Africans could trust. By doing so, India isn't just helping Africa rise. It's turning Africa into bricks territory, expanding the block's influence in ways America cannot ignore. Now, think about the symbolism here. For decades, the US dollar has been the king of global trade. You wanted to buy oil dollars. You wanted to secure loans, dollars. But BRICS is slowly pushing for alternatives, trading in local currencies, building a development bank, creating systems that bypass Washington's control. And with Africa leaning closer to bricks, that vision starts to look real. Imagine dozens of African countries trading with India and China in their own currencies backed by bricks financial systems. That's not just a shift. It's a revolution. What makes this silent revolution so powerful is that it doesn't announce itself with bombs, threats, or invasions. It grows in quiet contracts and handshake deals and trade agreements signed without headlines. And by the time America notices, it's already too late. That's exactly how India is playing this game. While Washington shouts about democracy and sanctions, New Delhi whispers about opportunity and partnership. And guess which voice Africa listens to. This is why Africa is the pivot. Bricks without Africa is a club. Bricks with Africa, that's a movement. A movement that challenges the dollar, challenges the old world order and gives voice to nations that were always sideline. India saw that potential and grabbed it. It connected bricks vision with African ambition, making itself the bridge not just between continents but between the future and the past. So when people say bricks is just a a talking shop, I laugh because in silence this revolution is building power. And India through Africa just positioned itself as the architect of that new world. America better wake up because while it's busy clinging to old power, a new system is being written right under its nose. Power makes you comfortable and comfort makes you blind. That right there is America's problem in the 21st century. For decades, the United States strutdded around the global stage with the confidence of a heavyweight champion who thought the belt would always be his. But here's the truth. If you stop training, if you stop adapting, someone younger, hungrier, and smarter is going to come for that belt. And in Africa, America's arrogance just opened the door for India to step in. Let's be honest, Washington didn't lose Africa because it lacked money or influence. It lost because it assumed dominance was permanent. US leaders acted like Africans had no choice but to take whatever was offered. Aid, loans, military presence. But times have changed. Africa doesn't want to be managed. It wants to be respected. And America never adjusted to that reality. It kept running the same playbook from the cold war talking about influence and e control while India rewrote the rules of the game. India came in humble. It came in listening. It came in saying, \"Oh, we know what it feels like to be pushed around by global powers. Let's rise together.\" That humility, that's not weakness. That's strategy. Because humility builds trust, and trust builds power. America didn't see that. Washington still thinks that throwing billions of dollars around is enough to secure loyalty. But money without respect is empty. It buys temporary compliance, not lasting partnership. Look at it like this. If you've got a friend who only calls you when they need something, how long before you stop picking up the phone? That's how Africa feels about America. But India, India showed up not just when it needed something, but when Africa needed something. Hospitals at training, renewable energy. India met Africa where it was, not where it wanted Africa to be. That difference turned into a weapon more powerful than any aircraft carrier or military base. And let me tell you, arrogance always backfires. America thought it could lecture nations into obedience. Instead, it drove them into the arms of new partners. It thought it could isolate bricks. Instead, it fueled its growth. It thought it alone would guaranteed loyalty. Loyalty. Instead, it exposed its own weakness. The blind spot wasn't money. It was mindset. America assumed the world would never change. India assumed the opposite and adapted. This is the lesson. Survival belongs to those who evolve. America had the muscle, but India had the mindset. Whoa. And on the battlefield of influence, mindset beats muscle every single time. If Washington doesn't learn that lesson, it's going to keep losing ground. Not just in Africa, but everywhere. Because the game has changed. Respect is the new currency. Adaptation is the new power. And humility, yes, humility is the weapon of the future. India figured it out. America hasn't. And until it does, it's going to keep getting outplayed one partnership at a time. We are living through a moment of awakening and most people don't even realize it yet. For decades, the world moved on autopilot. America sets the rules everybody else follows. But that era, it's cracking piece by piece right in front of our eye and Africa with India as its unexpected partner. Just send a message to the whole planet. The future belongs to those who respect, not those who dominate. This awakening isn't just about Africa or India. It's about a shift in the very definition of power. In the old world, power was measured in bombs and bases and bank accounts. But in the new world, power is measured in trust and respect and collaboration. And let me tell you, when a nation earns trust, it's stronger than when it commands fear. Fear fades. Respect last. That's the awakening America has been too slow to see. Think about it. Africa doesn't need handouts anymore. It needs allies to unlock its own potential. It doesn't need lectures. It needs partnerships. India saw that before anyone else and moved in not with arrogance but with humility. And by doing so, it didn't just gain influence, it reshaped the game. Now African nations are looking at New Delhi and saying, \"Here's a partner who understands.\" That changes everything. And here's where the future gets real. This awakening isn't limited to Africa. It's spreading. Countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, they're all asking the same question. Why do we have to play by America's rules? If India can step into Africa and build trust, then maybe Brazil can do it in South America. Maybe China can expand in Asia. Maybe smaller nations can finally punch above their weight. That's what scares Washington. Not the loss of one deal or one alliance, but the possibility that respectdriven partnerships will replace feard-driven dominance everywhere. For the average person watching this, let me break it down. The awakening means your world is about to change. The prices you pay, the alliances your country keeps, the news you hear every night. It's all going to shift as new powers rise and old powers fade. And guess what? You can't stop it. You can only choose whether to adapt to it. India just proved that strategy beats swagger, respect beats arrogance, and listening beats lecturing. That lesson isn't just for nations. It's for all of us. Because in your own life, the same principle applies. If you want loyalty, don't demand it, earn it. If you want influence, don't force it, build it. That's how you create something lasting. That's how you lead. So, what does this mean for the future? It means the monopoly is over. The game is wide open. Africa isn't waiting for permission anymore. India isn't asking for recognition anymore. And America, well, America has a choice. Wake up and adapt or keep clinging to the past until it's left behind. The awakening is here. The only question is who's ready for it? And there you have it. Africa isn't just a backdrop anymore. It's the front line of the new world order. India saw it, moved in with respect and rewrote the rules of the game while America was still busy patting itself on the back. This is bigger than trade deals, bigger than politics. This is about the future of power itself. The lesson is clear in this century. Respect is the currency. Humility is the strategy and partnership is the weapon. Those who adapt will rise and those who cling to arrogance will fall. So, as we watch India and Africa write a new chapter together, the question for America and for all of us is simple. Are we ready to wake up? To adapt, to adapt, to lead with respect instead of dominance? Because the awakening isn't coming someday. It's already here. And only the nations and the people who recognize it will own the future.\r\n",

         "🇿🇲 EXPLAINER | Zambia’s 2026 Budget: Big Numbers, Big Questions\nFinance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane tabled a K253.1 billion national budget for 2026, equal to 27.4 percent of GDP. It is the largest in Zambia’s history and the most domestically mobilized: K206.5 billion will come from tax revenue, with K12.1 billion from grants and K34.5 billion from borrowing. For the first time, Zambia is funding four-fifths of its spending from within. But behind the headline is a story of constraints.\nWhat Domestic Mobilization Means\nDomestic resource mobilization refers to how much of the budget government raises from taxes and local non-tax revenues rather than borrowing or aid. In Zambia’s case, 82 percent of the 2026 budget will be financed by domestic revenue. This is a historic level. It means less dependence on donors and external creditors, and more sovereignty in setting national priorities. But it also means the burden of taxation falls squarely on citizens and businesses. Every kwacha collected through VAT, PAYE, mining royalties, and corporate tax is what will drive schools, hospitals, and roads.\nWhy It Matters\nHigh domestic mobilization is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it signals fiscal maturity. Countries that raise their own revenue are less vulnerable to donor conditions and foreign shocks. On the other hand, in a fragile economy, heavy domestic taxation risks choking consumption and squeezing small businesses. The IMF has praised Zambia for widening its tax net, but many traders in markets or SMEs feel they are being taxed into the ground while service delivery remains patchy.\nDebt Still Heavy\nDebt service is the single largest item, consuming K73.6 billion. K52 billion goes to domestic repayments and K21.7 billion to external creditors. That is more than one third of the budget. Even after restructuring 94 percent of external debt, costly Treasury bills and bonds issued between 2015 and 2021 now falling due are leaving little room for fresh investment. This is the fiscal iron wall government cannot ignore.\nConstituency Development Fund (CDF)\nThe CDF has been raised from K36.1 million to K40 million per constituency, bringing the total envelope to K6.2 billion. Since 2022, the fund has delivered 2,800 classrooms and 131 health posts. But the allocation formula remains flat. Lusaka Central, with 150,000 voters, still receives the same as remote areas with 30,000. Without reform to factor population and poverty, the increase risks deepening inequality rather than fixing it.\nEnergy: The Elephant in the Room\nA new K500 million Electricity Fund has been introduced, including the Zambia–Tanzania interconnector and a five megawatt thermal plant in Lusaka. But the gap is vast. Drought cut hydro output by 40 percent, creating a shortfall of nearly 1,000 megawatts. Emergency imports are draining the treasury while exports continue under regional contracts. This contradiction fuels public anger. The fix is transparency. Publish quarterly data on imports, exports, and net balances. Without that, the public will see policy as spin, not substance.\nSocial Protection\nSocial protection has been allocated K15.7 billion, or 6.2 percent of the budget. Of this, K7.65 billion goes to the Social Cash Transfer, K1.03 billion to Cash-for-Work, and K1.5 billion to the Food Security Pack. Transfers remain unchanged at K800 per household and K1,200 for households with disabilities. The challenge is timeliness. If payments are delayed, the cushion collapses. Cash-for-Work in particular must evolve into a skills and employment ladder, not just temporary relief.\nEducation and Health\nEducation continues to dominate. Free education now covers 2.3 million children. Recruitment of 3,500 teachers and bursaries for 6,000 students is planned for 2026. Since 2022, over 28,000 students have benefited. But quality will depend on matching classrooms with teachers and timely funding. Health receives K6.4 billion for medicines and K953 million for equipment, alongside five new hospitals. After shortages in 2024 and 2025, this allocation responds to pressure, but the real test is whether drugs are consistently available on pharmacy shelves.\nAgriculture Push\nAgriculture has been given K15.5 billion, with K9.15 billion for the Farmer Input Support Programme, now expanded to all 116 districts. K2.1 billion is set aside for Strategic Food Reserves. Irrigation, veterinary services, and new drought-resistant seed projects are on the table. The ambition is bold: 10 million tonnes of maize, and one million tonnes each of wheat and soya by 2031. If logistics and trade policy lag, surplus risks turning into waste.\nElections and Governance\nThe 2026 general elections are budgeted at K1.19 billion. Unless ring-fenced, this will crowd out health and education spending. On governance, amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act and a new Medium-Term Revenue Strategy have been promised. These are important, but credibility will depend on whether political will holds during the campaign season.\nThe Bottom Line\nThis is Zambia’s biggest and most domestically financed budget yet. It signals fiscal strength but also exposes the risk of over-taxing a fragile economy. The weight of debt, the fragility of energy, and the rising cost of an election year leave little room for error. For ordinary citizens, the question is simple: will 2026 bring more power in their homes, more food on their tables, and more medicine in their clinics?\n📩 Readers are invited to share their thoughts with us at editor.peoplesbrief@gmail.com",

         "BREAKING: Angola Joins Burkina Faso’s Revolution With This Bold Move! - West TERRIFIED",
         "West TERRIFIED! Angola’s First Refinery Since Independence ECHOES Traoré’s REVOLUTION!▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n#africanamerican #africandiaspora #angola",
         "Тексты с изображений\r\nbreaking news! angola joins burkina faso*s revolution!\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Angola has just dropped a bombshell that's got the blood suckers of our resources. Those western corporations and their local lackey shaking in their stolen suits. Angola's announced its Kabinda oil refinery, the first since independence in 1975, will start pumping fuel by December 2025. This isn't just about refining oil. It's a full-on revolt against centuries of exploitation. A bold stand alongside Burkina Faso, Marley and Niger who are snatching back their gold, uranium and more. The looters are losing sleep because Angola's done playing their game. From Kabinda's crude to Zambia's pumps, this is the dawn of a new Africa. One where we process our own minerals, trade with our brothers, and build a future where the people, not the parasites, feast on our riches. Let's break it down raw and real. Because this is the Panaffrican uprising we've been praying for. Angola's a giant, sitting on enough oil to make the world jealous. 1.2 million barrels a day, second only to Nigeria in subsahara and Africa. But for decades, they've been robbed blind. Picture this. 98% of their crude shipped raw to Europe or Asia only to buy back refined diesel and jet fuel at prices that would make your ancestors weep. Right now, Angola imports 72% of its fuel, 3.3 million metric tonses a year, burning billions, while folks in Lwanda and Benuela quue for gas. Last year's subsidy cuts meant to save cash sparked riots that left 22 dead in July 2024. It's the same old neoc colonial scam, extract export impoverish. But the Cababinda refinery, a 30,000 barrel per day beast in the oil richch north, is flipping the script. Oil Minister Diamantino Azido dropped the news like a grenade. By year's end 2025, this $500 million project, majority owned by local investors via Gem Corp with Sonangal's 10% stake, will churn diesel, jet fuel, and NAFTA. What's this mean for the people? Everything. Cheaper fuel cuts transport costs so food doesn't cost an arm and a leg in a country where 40% live on less than $2 a day. Subsidies that drained $2 billion last year can fade without sparking more protests, freeing up cash for hospitals in Hambo, schools in Milan, roads in Moxico. Jobs over 2,800 workers, 85% Angolan, are already on site. From welders in Kabinda to engineers in Lwanda, building skills that stay home, not siphoned to London or Lisbon. Angola's not stopping here. Phase 2 doubles output to 60,000 barrels per day. and new refineries are planned for soyo and libidito. By 2030, they could cover half their fuel needs and even export surplus. This isn't just self-sufficiency. It's Angola stepping up as a southern African energy hub. Now, here's where it gets wild. Angola's not keeping this fire to itself. They're passing the torch to their African kin. Zambia, the copper king next door, is in advanced talks to import Angolan fuel, slashing costs by ditching Persian Gulf tankers. At a Lusaka forum in July, energy director Rodney Kota laid it out. Deals are nearly done with a Libito Lusaka pipeline in the works. Zambia's got a 26% stake in the LibO refinery set to fire up by 2026. President Hackinda Hitchima said it clear in 2023. Why haul oil from halfway across the world when our neighbors got it? This could drop Zambia's fuel prices by 20 to 30%, easing the quaar's strain and boosting copper belt mines. It's African trade done right. Short routes, low emissions, no western middlemen skimming profits. President Jo Lorenzo put it plain. Zambia wants our fuel. It's natural. We've got the muscle. From Lwanda to Lusaka, this is pan-Africanism in pipelines, not just talk. Zoom out and you'll see Angola's move is part of a bigger blaze. Bikina Faso, Mali and Niger, the alliance of Sahel states, AEN formed in 2023 after cutting ties with Akawaz and French puppeteers are leading the charge. Burkina under Captain Ibrahim Trareay kicked off their Marina gold refinery in November 2023. By late 2024, it's processing 150 tons a year. Africa's fourth biggest gold producer, keeping its wealth home. Before Trail Ray, they shipped raw doray bars to Switzerland for $300 an ounce. Now, 99% pure bars fetch $1,200 with $18 billion in revenue since 2022. Nationalized mines like Bongu and Wagnyon snatched from Canadians for $80 million boosted state stakes to 20%. Jobs 100 direct, 5,000 indirect, empowering women who once panned rivers for scraps. Marley's on the same wave. Their 2023 mining code mandates 10% state equity with an option for 20% more. They took Gangoto mine from Allied gold, handing it to the state. Gold, cotton, bork site, once France's cash cow, now fuel Bamako's rise. Niga, with 5% of the world's uranium, kicked France's Arano out of Sare, taking full control. Copper licenses now go to locals. Rare earths are eyed for batteries. The AES is more than a pact. It's mutual defense, a joint parliament by 2026, and a confederate bank to fund roads and grids without IMF chains. Trayore said it best. We're mining it ourselves. From jihadist shadows to sovereign strength, the Sahel's setting the pace. This is the new Africa, my people. A continent sick of being the world's raw material pit stop. Angola's Kabinda, Bikina's gold, Marley's mines, Niger's uranium. It's one fight. Process at home. Trade with kin. Build our own. African leaders wake up. Ghana's starting gold refining this year. Tanzania banned raw ore exports. Why ship DRC's lithium to China when Kaggali could refine it? Why Niger's uranium to France when Naomi needs power? Africa's got $2 trillion in annual mineral wealth. Cobalt, colan, oil, gold. Refine it, build with it, trade it. South South and we'd outshine the global north. No more $2 trillion in illicit flows to tax havens. No more begging for loans with strings. Before we continue, brothers and sisters, as the UN General Assembly continues, let's listen to the bold speech of Angola President at the UN. Your Excellency the President of the General Assembly, Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Excellencies, Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen. I stand before your excellencies in my capacity as president of the Republic of Angola and the current chairperson of the African Union to speak about my country to share our perspective on the evolution of the events unfolding in these increasingly troubled world and to discuss matters concerning Africa, a continent that mobilizes our energies and efforts as we seek solutions to finally awake it once for all towards development. Allow me to extend my congratulations to her excellency Anal Burbach on her election to the distinguished office of president of the United Nations General Assembly. convinced that her experience and the knowledge she has accumulated through the various functions she has performed with great mastery will ensure the success of the work she has taken on since the beginning of this month of September. I also would like to congratulate her predecessor, his excellency Filimon, for the assertive manner in which he precided over the general assembly during the past year, having devoted his utmost dedication to ensuring that this body should operate with commendable efficiency, a fact that rightfully deserves our collective recognition in light of the positive outcomes achieved throughout his tenure. I cannot fail to acknowledge his excellency Antonio Gutirez, Secretary General of United Nations for the role that he has so ely played with a profound sense of commitment underpinned by his admirable qualities as a man of dialogue and peace amid prevailing geopolitical complexities. Madame President, excellencies, 80 years have elapsed since compelled by imperatives of that era, a group of nations and their respective leaders took the wise decision to establish the United Nations organization which from that moment through both turbulent and peaceful instances had succeeded in fulfilling its great mission of maintaining ing the global peace and stability contributing to the advancement of humanity and to preserve and deepen respect for human rights. This is a great achievement of the peoples of our planet which cannot and must not be neglected and underestimated by any power, political leaders or by anyone lest by magnifying egocentric visions and interests. We forfeit the benefits of peace bequith to us by women and men who over time led us so far in an environment of harmony and global understanding. This journey has not always been linear. Yet in the most critical moments, prudence has prevailed over the worst impulses of large scale conflict. And this has been possible solely through continual dialogue, which has proven to be the only factor capable of bridging differences, overcoming obstacles, and appeasing even the most troubled and belligerent spirits. Today, these lessons from the past are of a great value and must serve as our sole references that guide us toward solution to the conflicts in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, in Asia, and wherever they may arise. Under the context of uncertainty in which we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, the theme better together 80 years and beyond for peace, development and human rights holds a significance that compels us to reflect upon the profound meaning of the appeal by her excellency the president of general assembly for the renewal of M literally ism and solidarity in action within a framework of collective and complimentary undertakings by a more agile, effective and responsible UN as invisited in the road map of the secretary general's initiative 80. In light of these perspectives, it is urgent that we revitalize the United Nations and lift it from the complex situation in which it find itself currently in order to restore the active role that he has always played. a strongly valuable role that during the cold war gave us assurance of never feeling as close to a global conflict as we do at this moment amid the profound distance prevailing in international relations. The main world powers appear to be turning their backs on one another, distancing themselves from even the most basic points of convergence that would allow them to remain committed to above all to the dialogue and concerted action. Today's challenges confront us with a choice. Either to do everything in our power to preserve peace or to face war with all its consequences, thus jeopardizing the future of humanity. Those were powers that in the past played a crucial role in the liberation of Europe and its people from the clutches of nism and fascism as well as in the liberation of Africa and its people from the apath regime in South Africa. cannot today act differently by aggressing other countries, invading and nexing foreign territories, nor by financing or organizing upheavalss that could cause the to the overthrow of legitimate governments as we currently witness in our own continent. With this dangerous president, no regional, continent or global institution will henceforth have the moral authority to call to to call any state to reason when it breaches the principles that govern the UN charter and international law. We Africans from countries that endured centuries of colonization perhaps understand better than anyone else the importance of peace. For we have had to face daily struggles to provide our people with food, clean water, health care, education and other fundamental necessities. This experience engenders heightened sensitivity to the harmful impact of that insecurity and instability have on the attainment of our goals and developmental projects. This reality is further exeated by numerous conflicts and wars afflicting countries and regions across the globe from which we had hoped to find cooperation and fruitful exchanges so that together we might overcome our difficulties and contribute with our immense resources and capabilities to global prosperity. It is upon this foundation that the Republic of Angola has sought to make an earnest and genuine contribution to resolving the conflict in the Sahel region in Sudan and in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo regarding which our efforts established a negotiation framework with P solution that regrettably did not come to fruition in December 2024 as anticipated, but nonetheless remains a the valid platform for further efforts being undertaken with the aim of bringing a definitive end to that conflict. Madame President, excellencies, that conflict and so many others that we recall are to a large extent the result of pacivity of the United Nations member states who have often revealed themselves to be ineffective in the face of invasion of third party territories and interference in internal affairs of sovereign countries that uh occurred over the recent years and have not provoked a firm, resolute and assertive reaction. Therefore, have become fitter comply that lie at the very center of the major tensions that the world is currently experiencing. The consequences of these are very evident before our eyes in the Middle East where the systematic failure to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolution regarding the creation of the state of Palestine has perpetuated a conflict that worsens with each day passing and appears to have no end in sight. in face of disproportionate and violent response and viol and retaliation by Israel which while having a right to exist as a state and to demand the release of those still held hostage from the tragic events of October 7th must not however be allowed to pursue in Palestine and particularly in the Gaza Strip a policy of extermination of a whole people. The Palestinian people who must not be conflated with Hamus for there is no peoples and certainly no children who are terrorist has precisely the same right to an independent sovereign state where they may assert their culture safeguard for the future and provide predictable and secure prospect for their youth. The concern surrounding that conflict grew ever more severely in the face of silence, hesitations and teamed response of the international community which seems to legitimize the expansion of war to other countries in the region inexably corroding the authority of the United Nations. There is nothing more serious than the exclusion of the delegation of Palestine from this forum where it should rightly have the opportunity to make its voice heard as member state in accordance with the terms of the host agreement. The failure to guarantee the presence of the present of the Palestinian Authority at this general assembly sends a profoundly negative signal as it encourages the continuation of genocide. We all are witnessing helplessly and with impunity which delays the resolution of the issue and complicates the efforts that have been made to bring an end to that intricate conflict. We strongly condemn this unilateral position which is contrary to the principles that govern the United Nations even as we urge unconditional lifting of the unjust and prolonged embargo against Cuba which has dire consequences for the economy and the living conditions of the Cuban people who struggle daily to withstand a punishment rejected by the international community as a Cuba which played an important role in the struggle of African peoples leading to the overthrow of the racist and inhuman apathide regime in South Africa and by virtue of these was a signary to the New York peace accord of December 22nd 1988 which brought freedom to the South African people and led to the independence of Namibia cannot be arbitrarily and unilaterally considered a state of terrorism in light of the relevant United Nation resolutions. This model of conduct by a small group of countries which does not conform to the even minimum acceptable standards of global coexistence is at the root of the unilateral and subjective sanctions imposed also on Zimbabwe and Venezuela. measures that produce no other results other than the suffering of population who in an act of great patriotism ultimately unite themselves in the defense of their nations. Madame President, excellencies, the authority of this organization whose foundation is the UN charter and international law must be urgently restored without narratives that highlight a logic of double standards. so that just solutions may be sought for the war in Ukraine or so that solutions proposed by the meeting held in Alaska may be reinforced. Ukraine being a European country after President Trump met with President Putin on a pragmatic manner and without prejudice to the need for direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine, one would expect that European leaders in an interest of Europe's peace and security would likewise seek direct dialogue not only with the President Zilinski but also with President than Putin. We cannot afford to squander this opportunity for otherwise we risk witnessing an escalation of unpredictable proportions and consequences not only in Europe where all active stakeholder must abandon the pillarist calculation rooted in the notion of military victory through the witnessing of adversaries capabilities. Is it is in the light of face of the present challenges and the ongoing global crisis that the United Nations must rem emerge and become more proactive lest its role as the main entity for global governments be diminished and be transformed into an institution incapable of ensuring world peace. Therefore, it is our responsibility as states and sovereign nations not to allow the UN to succumb. The United Nations in its present form is the sole organization with capacity to act on behalf of all of us in the quest for worldwide consensus in favor of peace with the legitimacy to call to reason those member states who undermine its foundational principles in their conduct on the international stage. For this reason, we must preserve it at all cost and adapt it to the realities of the contemporary world through the agently required reforms. In this most particular regard, I advocate for the reform of the security council in line with common African position set forth in the esolene consensus and in the third declaration adopted 20 years ago which called for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats for the African continent in an expanded security council that is more representative and consistent with the contemporary geopolitical realities. Without this industable state tape which has already experienced an unjustified delay, we will not be able to ensure the realization of the pact for the future adopted last year which recognized the urgent need to endow the United Nations with a more democratic and balanced security council. This pact represents a significant opportunity to revitalize multilateralism, rendering it more inclusive and capable of serving as a broader foundation for discussion on critical issues facing today's world. Amongst these I wish to underscore alongside many other relevant issues the issue of financing for development and climate challenge with regard to matters concerning support for development. There remains much to be discussed but also it's appropriate to recognize the recent progress achieved with the adoption of the severe commitment reached at the fourth conference on financing for development which advocates the urgent reform of international financial institutions so as to render them more representative, inclusive and equipped to address the pressing needs of the developing countries, especially those of Africa. I am convinced that this instrument combined with a pact for the future, the United Nation fiscal convention and the United Nation debt convention, steel and discussion will together serve as a political, financial and normative platform that will provide significant momentum to the achievement of the sustainable able development goals. Madame President, excellencies, it is essential that we confront the climate crisis as the greatest existential threat of our time, which can only be overcome through joint, coordinated, and united action. In view of the ongoing increase of global warming and the increasingly violent frequent natural res disasters, it has become imperative that the nations that which derived the greatest benefits from industrial and economic development in the past fully assumed today the historical responsibility ensuring as an act of climate justice, adequate financing, technology, G transfer and support for adaptation and mitigation for the developing countries. The countries with only residuals share in greenhouse gas emissions are those that disproportionately and virtually alone face the impact of climate change, global warming and the devastating effects on agriculture, food security and public health. In view of such evidence and the responsibilities arising there from Angola remains steadfastly committed to the Paris agreement and to the implementing adaptation and mitigation measures in an alignment with the United Nations 2030 agenda and the African Union 2063 agenda which enshrine the consensus concerning the mobilization of predictable affordable climate financing intended to ensure a just energy transition capable of protecting the most vulnerable communities. This crosscutting theme which demands increasingly heightened sense of responsibility both within the scope of public agendas and among major industrial corporations will receive due attention at the forthcoming COP 30 climate summit to be held shortly in Brazil which for the second time hosts an event of this magnitude. a testament to the country's commitment and engagement with environmental issues. In 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was inaugurated. A paradigm that has proven greatly beneficial through increasingly profound discussion that endured to this day and which will assuredly at the forthcoming conference enable us all to take another step forward on this long journey that we must undertake to achieve the major climate goals aspired by humanity. Excellencies 80 years after the founding of the United Nations and following the end of the cold war, our expectation was that we would be living in the world without present uncertainties and not as pelas as that which we now witness. Until 1991, we lived in a context marked by sharp division between two ideologically opposed blocks, which nevertheless offered a more predictable framework and was less susceptible to drifting into large scale confrontation. This flashback should not lead us to the conclusion that the global stability is only possible within a framework of rigid divisions of any kind. Rather, it should inspire us to build a system based on balanced interest and shared concern on matters pertaining to global security that fosters complimentarity and all forms of convergence within an environment of multilateralism which remains the sole pathway capable of preserving us from a true catastrophe. With these few words, I thank you for your kind attention. On behalf of the assembly, I wish to Angola's Kabinda refinery is more than steel and oil. It's a beacon of Africa's awakening alongside Bkina Faso, Maralley, and Niger. Angola is seizing its mineral wealth, breaking the chains of neocolonial theft. From fueling its people to powering Zambia's minds. This is pan-African unity in action. Processing at home, trading with brothers, building our future. The looters tremble because they see it. When Africa controls its riches, it controls its destiny. Let every leader heed this call. Refine our gold, our oil, our lithium, and watch the motherland rise as a global powerhouse. Umo Ninguvu. Unity is strength. The new Africa is here and it's unstoppable.\r\n",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:[Music] I thought if I did everything right, we'd never argue. I thought being perfect meant never needing help. But love is not in the flawless. It's in the trying, the forgiving, and the mess. This is perfect imperfections, unfiltered, unfinished, unapologetically human. Welcome back to Fire and Spice podcast. I hope you had your drink. Mhm. You you quenched the thirst. He came for us today, but I'm about to come for him. Mhm. Serious conversations. These are even more serious conversation. Mhm. Fireflies. [Music] I'm a firefree spices. Choose one. Whatever you want to be called. Haters. Haters. Spice people. spices. Hey any not even like maybe two episodes ago that when someone really wants to spend time with you they will create time. Yes. They will always create time. Mhm. And then you're out here telling us people are busy with their stuff. They just don't meet like more often like for social. They meet for business. For example, they meet for business. Is that why you we like I am busy. You are busy. Amen. You're welcome for my contribution. And you're doing a good job, right? What spice, right? Fire. Yeah. Why is there a conundrum? I don't know. People have been calling me fire. Do I look spicy? Maybe your hair [Music] after the break. What were we talking before we went for the break? cuz now I'm feeling like every episode has us thinking [Music] 10 episodes in. I hope you all feel the way I feel like we have room for growth as human beings. I've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from from ourselves. I didn't think we had this many points. Did we even have a And from hearing from you guys eye opener. Yeah. An eye opener. And today we're dealing with the topic of success. So yeah, by the way success on a simple on a simple definition. Mhm. A success is just achievement of your goal like and then when you achieve them become successful. As simple as that. So depending on your goals, I was giving these examples here. You have that maybe money but you don't have those people. M that is why they say it's it's lonely there at the top you don't have those people yes they create time for you and when they create time for you is not the social life is time either for business or family for a reason not just to have And that was what I was trying to say. Like we would meet when we are down there, we would meet for no reason because we And that is the difference now. Now when you do that mhm and that is why I said poverty mashida they unite people they bring people everybody can relate on some level. Everybody can relate with this poverty with this easy mashida where you with these struggles everybody can relate to. So it unites people. I can relate to you can relate to me. We form a group. Yeah. So that is what I was trying to say. But just because I am successful doesn't mean I change. But you did change. It's just that I cannot deal with your change. What changed? the way you carry yourself. I don't think it's cuz you just said you meet now with people for a purpose. That's change. So me maybe I'm the change is not intentional. It is intentional. It's it's it's the level that I am in brings that brings the change. It is intentional. Okay. The problem is I am refusing to accommodate your change. Uh-huh. Yes. Let me let me probably dig myself a very deep hole and take this to a to another whole kind of different topic. Mhm. So, I think I think we're talking about the drunk and whatever. Oh, yeah. So success is when we achieve our goal. Whatever your goal is. What if the the success is me healing or me disconnecting myself from the dysfunction of even poverty on some level is a dysfunction. It's it's something that I don't want to nobody wants to live in poverty. So what if my goal is to pull myself from this situation, right? So my goal is to heal, to disconnect myself from poverty, from dysfunction, from toxicity, from all this thing. The achievement of my goal is change. Then what am I going to do with you now? Now you have to find a way to deal with that side of me. And it is very hard when you're not broken. And that is how we separate because you don't know me. You cannot handle me on that side. You only knew to handle me on the other side. But this side of me you cannot handle. Then that is how we separate. Or I don't know how to. That is how we separate. And it's okay. That is okay. It feels like a lot of separation in this thing. It is. It is. Uhhuh. If we used to know I will call you right now. I cannot. In fact, I cannot relate as much as you want. I don't drink anymore. Maybe change. So you don't know how to handle the sober me. So yeah, you don't know how to handle, you know, there's like a whole movement of that, right? Oh yeah. So the sober me but it is you who just but the sober you doesn't want to hang out with me then follow me but I don't want to be sober. That is when separation comes. There's a lot of separation. That is where separations come because anymore cuz I don't drink anymore. You cannot call me. Then you cannot relate. I cannot you cannot relate with me because where you hang out is not where I hang out. And you don't want to come to where I hang out because maybe it's boring. I don't want to come to where you hang out because it's too noisy. So, we separate. And it is okay. Is it? Yeah, it is okay. I get what you mean by it's okay. Mhm. I actually understand. Mhm. But it sounds like life in itself is a whole bunch of separations. Growth. Growth. Then there's a problem. There's always going to be Oh, yeah. There's always there's always a place for you. This is what I'm trying to say. These separations, they happen every time. How do you see Maringo? No, that is what I said before we went for a break. Mhm. Because you cannot handle me there. I don't have to deem my lights to fit in your company. But it still it still feels bad when you know that familiar thing where you have this friends, there's relationships that you've built for years. Mhm. And they're not there anymore. So you have to deal with the pain of not having that anymore. That's my point. Like I'm not I don't have a problem with the separation. Let me give you this example. Mhm. You grow a tree, a fruit tree, whether mango, whether orange. It takes years before you start eating the fruits. Okay. Mhm. The first year you eat the fruits. Very sweet. Very nice. that season goes, you'll have to wait for another season to pick other sweet mangoes from the same tree, not the same mangoes you picked last year. Yeah. Okay. So, [Applause] and the tree continued to grow. Yeah. And when the season comes to bring forth the fruits, it still brings fruits. But the same people, they are not they are not eaten by the same people who ate last year. Even if the neighbors will eat, the tree continues to grow and every season, every season new fruits. So every season of your life you bring you will just have new friends. Every season. Every season. And those who stay with you are the branches. Are the branches cuz the branches they grow with the tree. Tree from the branches but they grow together with the tree. So every season this tree has good fruits and bad fruits the same. So those are the seasons of life. When people fall off, it's okay. It's okay. Continue growing. It doesn't stop you from growing. Continue bringing forth fruits. Don't stop to grow because somebody has somebody else grow. Let me tell you that another example. Uhhuh. The same garden can have mangoes here, oranges here, maybe at apples over there. But just because mangoes doesn't mean doesn't mean because mangoes doesn't mean Yeah. What I'm trying to say is growth is continuous. It doesn't wait. It doesn't stop. You just Oh my god. This this is really good. Well, somewhere along there's a person that has planted an apple tree. Mhm. Evil too. It's like along the road. Mhm. For the long for all season, we thought they were peaches. Cuz all you can see is the color from afar. M. So we kept saying we're going to stop and tune us some. We're going to stop and get some. We're going to and the season. But this person never picked anything from the tree. So the tree has grown grown. The fruits are falling. They are not even some of them have been eaten by birds. Some of them have rotten on the ground. So two weeks ago I decided to stop. First of all, I was so wrong about the tree cuz it was an apple tree. But it's exactly how you said the fruit the tree had so many fruit and now that the season is changing none of them is going to be left on the tree but the tree is still going to grow but also because the season is changing all the fruit is going to fall all the leaves are going to fall it's going to be left brown and then next Yeah. Toa to green to something to something and the cycle starts again. There are some Yeah. When the leaves fall off Mhm. that's your scarcity moment. You still have the branches. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. You still have the branches with you in every season. Whether the tree looks like it's drying up. Are your branches though? Exactly. Do we have those branches that can be with us in all seasons? And that is why I said when we started, if there's somebody who can clap for you when you win Mhm. without envy, those are your branches. Many people will be with you when you are suffering, when you are struggling. But they cannot handle the other side of you when you we some take it as a threat. Some take it as some whatever they take it as. Mhm. Some trees when those fruits fall, when the season is going to end, whatever has fallen might be seeds. Mhm. Other trees will grow from the seed that was never eaten as a fruit. Something will come from the seed that just fell. Maybe ground ground. See, most of us cuz even when you were talking, I was thinking about that tree. The owner doesn't care. Mhm. The owner planted the tree, it's there, doesn't pick it. There's always going to be someone who comes along your way and picks from your tree. To emphasize on your point, you might be a very fruitful tree. Mhm. But you will not eat your own fruits. A mango doesn't eat mangoes. It drinks water. [Laughter] Orange. An orange tree doesn't eat oranges. See, some of us it feels Hey, this is getting to a good point. Anyway, some of us feel like nobody sees you. Have you ever been in that season? It's not that you're not fruitful. It's not like you're not growing but nobody seems to see you. Can I give you an example of the same? Yes. You see that tree that you said you've been seeing it has so many fruits. They look they even they even ripe but nobody eats from that tree. Yeah. Until I That is that moment when you feel that you're growing and nobody sees you. But they're seeing in you and passing like they're like in they just pass and that discourages you. That might discourage you not to grow, not to bring forth fruits anymore. Yeah. Well, yeah. Because if you can bring these kind of sweet fruits there, you you can't eat on your own fruits. People don't want your fruits. They just pass by looking at those good trees, good good fruits. They are intimidated with your win, with your growth. They don't want to pick those tree, those mangoes, those those ripe ones. We want the one that's planted in the orchards. The one that we're going to go pick, the one that puts uh fun the way it looks. Let me tell you. I'm going to wait for you till you're at the top. Then I'm going to need you. Somebody said Uhhuh. Not even somebody said. I'll give you an example. I think I don't remember where I had this example, but a water bottle on a store is maybe $1. Yeah. The same water bottle airport 10 bob. Uhhuh. The same water bottle or club 15 bob. It is the same water bottle. Mhm. But where you you are placed? Where you are placed it is the same one. You see it will still be the same fruit. But how? Mhm. We have the gift. We can move. Mhm. Is it safe to say move yourself to the airport? position yourself the right place cuz I feel like there people in your life that will keep you as that $1 water bottle. You're accessible. You're available. You're there. They don't value you. They know. The problem is it's not it's not even the value. I know what you're capable of, but the son of a carpenter. Yeah, I know what you're capable of, you're there, but where it will be your choice to either be available and accessible to the whole conglomerate that is there would I move myself to a higher place where I'm more valuable increase your worth if if that's a I would say this moving yourself sounds like a lot of work. It's not like to make a decision of moving like do you know what it means? Separation. Exactly. So these have been my friends. These have I need a support team. This is not working. These have been my friends for years. I don't want to lose them just because I'm successful. Now you are deeming your lights. So now to fit in this company, Nika, I have to leave this. So leave, move, position yourself. Yes. Let whoever will move with you follow so that when when you win they win or there's a possibility for them winning because they just right next to you but I don't know if you guys are like me but this journey that you're telling us of moving Mhm. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. For example, I want to leave smoking. Mhm. I cannot just There are some people who just wake up and they're like, I will not smoke anymore. And they But there are some people who will just decide I've been smoking a packet anymore. Mhm. But it is achievable at the same time. Mhm. It has to start with you. It all begins with you. It doesn't start. Nobody else will make will make that decision for you. It has to start with you first. But when it starts with you, when you decide to move then you start a long journey. You don't move. Yeah. That is the long journey to success. And that is why it is difficult for when you move it is difficult for people to handle you in that face in that season of life. You're not the same person anymore. You look so different. You are you don't look so you you are different. You are not the person they knew anymore. You don't speak like you you used to. You don't do things that like you used to. So, what am I supposed to do with you? You follow me and find out what I did. And I'll be kind enough. Mhm. To give you the information. Are we unfair? Mhm. That we want people to behave the same like I can follow you if I want. Mhm. And I follow you cuz I want to be cuz you're getting successful and I want to be part of your journey to success, but I want you to behave or to to relate with me the way you related with me before. Is it unfair? It is unfair. That is unfair. Why I'm saying is unfair is because I remember there's a episode we said build something that people cannot destroy. Mhm. I'm building a character here. Oh, that you cannot destroy. Yeah. So, I am not behaving as I used to. I am not addressing you as I used to. I'm more respectful right now. I am watching my language. I am watching how I speak because I want to speak like success. Have you ever seen people It doesn't matter how Mhm. No, I know what you mean. I I've always like I don't know how people deal with it, but when you're the youngest in the room, so I went to school. M but I was always the youngest in the class. So I went to high school and everybody was like at least maybe 13, 14. I was still like I had just turned 12. Yeah. Like I graduated high school when I was like 16 years old. 16. I was not I was not smart. Like I just don't know how these circumstances happen. I have to ask my parents. me, but I was always the youngest in the room. So that translates to I'm in a job field and the place I'm at 20 years, they're now there. And me, I just came or I'm still young. I'm not as old as you are. And most people will think you don't deserve to be here cuz you're not like me or you haven't gone through the process or whatever. And so I used to complain to my mom. I'm like, uh, this person that I'm working with has been in the company for 20 years and just got promoted to this position and we're having problems. And it went for my first job. She let me quit. The second one, she was like, \"Listen, you're not getting you're not going to change.\" Mhm. Even 40 years from today, you're still going to be the youngest cuz that person also is getting old. M so you have to learn how to talk like you have sense just like you said talk like you have sense carry yourself like you have be the most deserving person to be in that room and for a while I was like this doesn't make sense but I realized if I talked a certain type of way if I dressed a certain type of way if I carried myself a certain type of way people related to me different and so Even now in ministry, I just translated it cuz I'm still the youngest in the room and I have to be seated in tables like now like most people even the people we're doing now some of them are in their 60s 80s and I have to sit in that table like I deserve to be there and not be stupid the the Bible says don't just say talk like a wise person dress. Like the moment you enter into that room, even if they knew you are and they had already disqualified you, they look at you, they're like, but the way they you dress, you enter into a room, they look at you, they're like, and it means that they might be important or things that are relatable to everybody else. Cuz that means that when my peers are doing some certain things, I can't. Yeah. Cuz there's an eye that is looking that will disqualify me if I carry myself that way. And at the end of the day, it translates into success. True. That you'll be able to sit in tables that you probably don't deserve, but by the way you carry yourself. But most of us are slaves of people wanting you to continue to treat them the same way you treated them before. So because you knew me when I was with you somewhere in school, you want us to continue talking that way, but I'm not the same person. And that is the expectations of people. And and that is where if you don't talk to them the same way they expecting, then they are offended. And then you change. [Music] So they having a problem with you because you've decided not to come down to their level. But they if they just follow you to your level, we all succeed. Then you all succeed. My win is a possibility of your win. And you know as much as I am hating the fact they keep telling us about separation but anyway it it maybe is a good thing notice when you're up there. Mhm. Uh let me give this example. You know Bishop O of Winners Chapel, right? The founder. Yeah. So he said when he was just starting Winners Chapel Mhm. he struggled to get a car. Mhm. Then he struggled some days to fuel the car. Mhm. But he was preaching and he said, \"Right now, if I stand here and I'm preaching to you and I say my car does not have gas, someone will go to the store and get me another car. Another one will bring gas. Another one will go to the gas well where they dig and the access that I have now by virtue of rising to this level means that I don't have to ask for some things. truck. You ask me for gas money. I'm like, why did you buy a car if you can't afford gas? But right now, if I just stand here and I'm telling people, I don't have this. They're like, uhhuh, you you cannot be there and you don't have they even buy you a store. You you like I don't have a shoe to wear with this suits. How they address you when you win is not how they address you when you're down there. So our common enemy should be one failure, poverty. Let us just fight poverty and stop fighting each other. Like common enemy should be poverty. It's as simple as that. Two are better than one. Yeah. One kills a thousand, two kills 10,000. You see? Uhhuh. It is very hard. My I don't know who gave this example. I think it's my mom or whatever. If you take a stick easily to destroy you, you can't even break them. Yeah. The unity is what? Hey, a three strand cord is hard to break. So just because I'm up there following me, following me is protecting this cycle, this unity. Leaving me You are exposing me to the enemy and we are good. We are stronger together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are stronger together. And I wish people will see that instead of looking at me as a threat, see me as I go up as a way of u let's go. Yeah. Lifting each other. Cuz I need you. Mhm. And I need you. Let me tell you, but I think it's pastor who are saying that the most difficult seasons of your life or the most times that you need people in your life that I want your money But sometimes you just need companion. That person that is just there to support you. Like you're going up and I'm like, \"Yay, keep going. Keep pushing. You You got this. Let's go.\" And that is bigger support than me telling you, \"He's 200. Keep pushing.\" Let me tell you an example that just came into my mind. Mhm. Just the other day they were having a football in in in Kenya and in Africa. And so it was this narrative that when Tanzania were playing just because their tickets were cheaper, Kenyan bought all the tickets. Mhm. Do you know why? Psychologically if there's nobody cheering you, Chiefs, we had a game with you guys. First of all, we won. Praise the Lord. Start by introducing the same game. What are you talking about? We were It's weird to call it football. Exactly. Anyways, football. He supports Chiefs. I support Eagles cuz that's what normal people do. And we actually defeated you Janna Joy. But we were playing at your place, Kansas. Mhm. And the whole field was red. But the beauty like something really cool I saw there were eagle fans who like flew there. Mhm. And there was like this whole bunch of green that made the game tolerable for these people. Like these people were crazy in the field. And I think they did such a good job of hyping these people. But the first game that Eagles played, I think with the Cowboys and we were playing home, these people entered the field. There was no way. [Music] They were so sad. They lost. They were not motivated. How can you win? Yeah. the same cheer me up if I don't have somebody to cheer me up you brave you like I need a in school I was part of the cheering footballing and we used to do a good job. Did you really imagine school was not in the map? We are coming back home with the same bus. Bye. So it is first come first. And the same thing I will say if you win people will treat you with respect. It is true. It is true. People will treat you with respect. will make sure but it's the right people. We take care of you. The right people. Now, if you don't get these people who cheer you up without envy, Nobody care. But right now And I see my you know like this is a success is a friend and an enemy. When you say it's an enemy, what do you mean? It's lovely and it's something that we all want to be. Mhm. But success has its wounds. M I want to know more because from always talking about it doesn't sound like like to come overnight success and sometimes it doesn't have to be your story a faithful day. It's the things that you have to do to be successful. It might not be but outgrowing a season and people and even leaving people that were in my previous season is also very hurtful when you have to grieve as you move cuz you don't stop. Yeah. That is what I'm trying to to clarify. When we talk about success, we are not talking about money alone. Yeah. We are not just talking about you buying a good car. We are not talking about you buying a a good house. We are not talking about you dressing the most expensive suits or shoes or whatever. That's not the only success. If that is success to you, it is your definition. That's fine. I have no problem with you. But we are talking about success even in character. Yeah. Your emotional health. Emotional health, mental health. Very very important. Yeah. Success. I'm not living this life anymore. This is the route I'm taking. the right way that is success. So th those people who can follow you in that direction are very few very few. It's you've chosen a different path like like just how you said your mental health. Um maybe there's there's a cycle, there's whatever. Even in friendship, there's just friendships that are comfortable because they're familiar, but they're not good for your mental health at all. At all. And you decide to I want to choose myself. I want to take care of myself. Let me move. That journey will come with wounds. These people will insult. These people will do. Do you know why? Mhm. These people insulting you because you have healed and you are reminding them. You are reminding them of their unhealed wounds. move on and you're doing okay. Now what am I supposed to do exactly? We are talking about emotional health and success. I'm not healed. You are healed and you're moving on well and you're happy. So I don't want to be associated with you because I'm reevaluating. Next time when we tell you to pause, it's a very heated episode. But I have this person when I have like my boy moments, they're always available. Like we can be on the phone for 3 hours. If I'm miserable, I if something is happening like girls, I don't know about you, but that friend that is always available when your man does something like we argue and then we on the phone for 3 hours. What did he do? Oh, you deserve better. Oh, blah blah blah blah blah blah. And we're on the phone. This person is always available. I'm being miserable in some other. They're always available. But they will never be available when my my relationship is going well or whatever. They're not available. How dare you? When I call, how dare you succeed? Let's say it's like, oh, uh, he bought me flowers or that conversation doesn't last 10 minutes. I don't like at first I didn't know cuz when you're miserable you just you know you need that time but then I I was having a good a good time and you know you want to share with somebody in your moment of trouble. You will always find somebody to help you to be miserable with me. No not even to be miserable with you to handle that side of you. They can handle this whole night. They will stay with you. If they can they cannot be there with you. No, they they they might not be there with you at that time. But even if it is booking therapy for you, they will pay for you to heal. Like they will find a solution for you to get well. But the problem is when you get well, they cannot handle that side of you. Why? Cuz for me, you see a friend in need is our friend indeed say is a white man. But at first I was like, \"This is a really good friend and we've been friends for for a long time.\" Until my sister was like, \"When it's horrible, this person is always there when you're having a good time. Even even not like a big deal like showing up for your birthday, for your graduation, for your graduation.\" They don't show up. They have excuses. technical 1 hour a mean let me send you let me send you a little gift here but they're not there I'm like you are on the phone with me for hours when I was miserable you know I was I just need you to celebrate with me yeah cuz I was reading your story and it kind of is a sad story so this girl was talking well she was giving her story and then someone was reacting to it and she said she was having miscarriages just and she had had like six of them and it's horrible. It's hard on your own marriage. It's hard on your body. So, but she's saying they were people who are always there. Keep pushing. Keep trying. They will come even to your house. They will stay there. They will cook. They will bring whatever you need. They will wash. They are there for you. They are there. She's like they were there and then because God is good she got pregnant and she got a baby. They couldn't understand that. How? And it's not even at people disappeared. They they they didn't know how to celebrate that. She was like when I was miserable people sent me messages. This person called me all the time. But when I got my baby, they didn't reciprocate that into thanksgiving, into celebration, into I cannot believe this happened. I am so happy for you. I the million messages you're sending her of God. The million memory verses that you're sending you, they don't have celebration memory verses or Thanksgiving, nothing. She was like it was a quiet season which was supposed to be the loudest season of your life when you finally are at a good place. That is why I told you it is lonely at the top. Whatever your top is, your top might be that bundle of joy you're holding like you've been waiting for years. You've been praying for years with people, with prayer warriors, with ushers. But when you finally they are not there to save and thank you with you. When you finally have that bundle of joy in your hands, there are no people to celebrate with you. And that is why I said if you find somebody to clap for you and I will repeat again to celebrate with you without being envy. That is a close person to keep. Those people who show up when you're in problems. Those people who show up when you're in need. Those people who show up in your worst. Mhm. They might not be the genuine friends that you're looking for. That's scary. Cuz you know, we measure people by the ones that show up in your dark because they feel needed. That is why they are there. It is humanity to help. Wow. They feel like a rescuer. They have they are there. They are obligated to do that. Jesus. Mhm. Because they can relate to that problem. A a friend had that problem and they stood with them. Family had that problem. They can relate to what you're going through. But but they cannot relate with your success. Maybe your success or they're just mean people. They never saw you succeeding and they don't know how to handle you in your success. Shindu and let me tell you many of them are not just mean by the way. It's just that they don't know how to handle you in that season. empty. [Music] Finally, [Music] some of them Some of them I got to get what I I need from you any means possible. Exactly. So if you are with me for what I am giving you. I love you still and you're not there. No. is true love. So this is what I will say. Don't I will repeat again. Don't deem your light to fit. Yeah. To your company. Let them celebrate you. Let them clap for you. Clap for the ones that are ahead of you. So that when you are you are going up the way you are treating people is the same way you'll be treated and then don't expect people to treat you the way you don't treat other people I know this will sound very whatever but grow an intentionality and a conscious of always being very cons yeah yeah always be very conscious ious of how you make people feel. Yeah, you're not responsible for my reactions. You're not responsible. But be very conscious of how you make people feel because that will help you to uh grow and have social intelligence cuz I think most people don't have social intelligence and your social equity is probably the most the riches that you will never ever compensate like the people the the same way you said when you have those people that clap for you without envy. Most of us don't take care of that social equity. You don't take care of those people. You don't take care of those relationships. So, be conscious enough of how you treat people. Also, you don't have to take off the crown from my head for you to have a crown on your head. We can all have crowns on our heads. We can all be great and doesn't mean anyone is greater. There's a room for everybody to grow. There is room. Yeah, there's room. There is no competition of like we can all do the same thing and we still have room because we are all unique. Yeah. So don't you don't have to take away my crown for you to wear yours. And that is episode 10 after support. That was a lot. Thank you. It was You're welcome. That ...",

         "🇿🇲MY 1% | Understanding Zambia’s 2026 National Budget\nGovernment has unveiled a K253.1 billion budget for 2026, equal to 27.4 percent of GDP. It is the largest domestic-mobilized budget in the country’s history. Of the total, K206.5 billion will come from domestic revenue, while K12.1 billion will be secured through grants and K34.5 billion through borrowing. The arithmetic shows that Zambia is depending more on its own tax base, but it also highlights how narrow the fiscal space remains, given the weight of debt service.\nDebt and Fiscal Space\nDebt service remains the single largest line item. K52 billion will go towards domestic debt servicing, while K21.7 billion will cover external debt. In total, debt service will consume K73.6 billion, which is more than one third of the entire budget. The Minister highlighted that much of this is due to Treasury bills and bonds issued between 2015 and 2021 now reaching maturity. Even with 94 percent of debt restructured, high domestic interest costs leave limited room for capital investment. This means government priorities will be rationed against what debt obligations leave behind.\nConstituency Development Fund (CDF)\nThe CDF has been raised from K36.1 million to K40 million per constituency, bringing the national envelope to K6.2 billion. Since 2022, this fund has financed 2,800 classrooms and 131 health posts. However, the allocation formula remains unchanged. A constituency like Lusaka Central, with over 150,000 voters, will still receive the same as a remote seat with fewer than 30,000 people. This flat system undermines equity. Reform is overdue. The principle should be a base grant for every constituency, plus a population and poverty-weighted top up. Without that change, the K40 million increase risks entrenching inequality.\nEnergy and Load-Shedding\nEnergy security has been allocated K500 million to establish an Electricity Fund. This will support diversification of the energy mix and finance projects such as the Zambia–Tanzania interconnector. A five megawatt thermal plant is scheduled for commissioning in Lusaka. These steps are positive but too modest for the scale of the problem. The drought reduced hydro output by more than 40 percent, creating a shortfall of nearly 1,000 megawatts. As a result, Zambia has imported expensive emergency power while still exporting under long-term regional contracts. This contradiction fuels public frustration. The solution is not to cancel contracts but to provide transparency. Government should publish quarterly data on imports, exports, and net balances. Citizens must see the numbers to trust the policy.\nSocial Protection and Cash-for-Work\nThe budget sets aside K15.7 billion for social protection, equal to 6.2 percent of the total. Within this, K7.65 billion goes to the Social Cash Transfer, K1.03 billion to Cash-for-Work, and K1.5 billion to the Food Security Pack. Transfers remain at K800 per household, and K1,200 where there is a person with a disability. These allocations are significant, but credibility will depend on execution. Payments must be made on time. Cash-for-Work, in particular, requires redesign. With over K1 billion allocated, the programme should not be treated as temporary relief. It must link participants to skills and small enterprise employment. Otherwise, the fund risks becoming consumption rather than empowerment.\nEducation and Human Capital\nEducation remains one of the biggest commitments. Free education now supports 2.3 million children enrolled in schools. The budget will fund the recruitment of 2,000 teachers in 2025 and 3,500 more in 2026. It will also expand bursaries, with 6,000 additional students expected to benefit in 2026, adding to the 28,212 students supported since 2022. These numbers are meaningful, but quality of education will also depend on timely release of funds for infrastructure, materials, and rural teacher deployment. The new classrooms delivered under CDF must align with these teacher recruitment figures to balance supply and demand.\nHealth and Social Services\nHealth has been allocated K6.4 billion for procurement of drugs and medical supplies, and K953 million for equipment and maintenance. In addition, five new Level One hospitals will be built in Kabwe, Monze, Choma, Zambezi, and Lusaka. This is a response to public pressure after frequent shortages of medicines in 2024 and 2025. The key test will be whether this allocation translates into consistent supply chains, not just headline figures.\nMining, Industry, and Foreign Exchange\nThe mining sector receives K1.2 billion, with K541 million for geological mapping and K449 million for artisanal miners. Copper production is expected to rise toward the one million tonne mark. Output grew by 12 percent in 2024 and surged 30 percent year on year in early 2025. Despite this, the kwacha still traded between K22 and K28 to the dollar, highlighting Zambia’s vulnerability to external shocks. Government has bought $322.6 million worth of gold reserves, and the export tracking framework has channelled $16 billion into the banking system since 2024. These are important monetary reforms, but without a clear foreign exchange stress test in the Budget, public confidence in kwacha stability will remain fragile.\nElections and Governance Costs\nThe 2026 general elections are budgeted at K1.19 billion. This figure, while unavoidable, will squeeze fiscal space further. Government must ring-fence this spending and disclose quarterly release plans. Otherwise, election spending will crowd out critical service delivery in health, education, and infrastructure. On governance, amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act and a new Medium-Term Revenue Strategy are promised. The effectiveness of these measures will depend on political will during an election cycle.\n⬆️ Disclaimer: This analysis is independent and based on the official 2026 Budget Speech.

The day that the minister of finance national planning will be unveiling the 2026 national budget. Uh in the 2025 uh you know budget, government proposed 217.1 billion budget. So everybody is waiting to see how much is going to be proposed for next year. That's 2026. I'm so excited as a jo I'm not alone. I'm joined by my very good friend post who's been doing this all the time you know last week and I know that uh you know there's a lot of people that you have been you know talking to and today is a D finally I don't know why you want to make me feel like I'm a guest but I'm not presenter but anyway thank you so much wherever you are we're excited because the minister of finance any minute from now should be arriving here at parliament We've been interacting with various um stakeholders and the expectations are very very high looking at where the country is coming from the drought uh that uh hit the country and also when you look at the supplementary budget that the minister of finance presented to parliament which was approved by parliament. So a lot of expectations very high. The energy sector uh has faced quite a number of of challenges. Everyone, every Zambian is complaining about uh uh the load shedding, the load management and earlier in the day um a very interesting conversationary fund and Eric uh Luch who who just brought quite a number of issues how the IMF is working with uh the Zambian government to make sure that the debt is restructured. So I'm looking forward to the figures that the minister of finance will be projecting today. Absolutely. And a lot of people actually are saying you know certain you know sectors will be allocated a little more than you know they were located last year like the agricultural sector, the energy sector you know like he mentioned the health sector, the education sector. We know that the president a fortnight when he was here uh to officially open parliament. He actually did say that teachers have been you know recruited for like you know next year. The health sector actually also is recruiting about 2,000 you know health workers and people are saying recruitment yes but there needs to be you know service delivery that is supposed to be improved despite you know you know recruiting all these teachers and health makers. So we're yet to hear what's the minister of finance actually you know going to say regarding that and allocation to a health you know ministry of health the ministry of education and other key sectors of the economy. Well, when you analyze uh the president's address, a fortnight like you rightly put it, at least it will give you an indication how um the road map will be in terms of uh what the president talked about. So, he gave a road map. Now, it's up to the minister of finance to fund uh those pronouncements that the president made during his address when he was officially opening the fifth session of the 13th assembly. So the expectation really really very very very high and u I don't know which sector would you love I'm not going Agriculture. This is a rigorous process and a number of stakeholders have been involved in this process and uh the ordinary Zambian citizen out there have their own expectations. They've been involved in one or the other because we've been having you know conversations with them for and uh they've got quite a number of expectations. So maybe we should you know see what they have to say. The budget estimates and expenditure will be presented by the minister of finance. I know is something that the National Assembly has interest in staff and state orient them. What is expected of them during this rigorous um exercise that will take place start today where uh ized by various uh parliamentary committees that that we have. It's something that I'm looking forward to. Uh members of the excitement it's a time to interact with various they feel and uh I was talking to is excited. parliament that national assembly. Others will have an extension of parliament at Mongushi conference center where their members of parliament will be able to scrutinize uh uh the budget for 2026. And another interesting aspect new dimension worth mentioning is uh the issue to do with cabinet ministers expected now to make policy statements. Previously it was our owner uh the vice president who was handling uh the provinces but at least it's something that various stakeholders were very excited knowing that provincial ministers who are on the ground with these people in all the 10 provinces will be able to make a poly statement and be uh uh given an opportunity to interact with various stakeholders based on their location in in these provinces. Absolutely. So our esteemed viewers will be interested to know that starting next week for the next 20 days business of the house is going to be suspended to enable you know members of was on the inclusive growth and our fingers crossed. We don't know what the minister's will be this time around. So I don't know. We can speculate looking at what the country has been grappling with the issue to do with uh with energy empowerment as well. So I'm very excited for it. I know we all are excited and looking forward to the minister's uh you know budget presentation anytime after 14:15 that is going to be happening right here on parliament you know television. So we need to move on person. Yes, we went around the city of Lusaka just to interact uh with people. Random um expectations were brought out from various uh stakeholders and uh let's us here to some interesting expectations. As you know that my colleague said this project. Are we going to see these voices from various people? Heat. Heat. Where are you? Uh my expectation is to see an increase in terms of uh the budget allocation towards education. Uh for so long there has been um a big gap in the education sector specifically in issues to do with addressing the needs of persons with disabilities of the country. We are interested to hear what is in the in the budget for the finance minister. Following the fact that as you know Zambia has got a lot of childrens that are not yet even in school despite the free education system but others are still languishing in in the communities around there. So we are hoping to see that in the budget that the refinance minister presents is going to is going to cut a bigger portion for the education system as well as in the health sector. the health sector. When you look at the way our patients are being attended out there, at times you even wonder what happens in terms of medicines and stuff because most of the times you take a patient to to a health center, you come to discover that of the medicine website is not there. It will be given to they write a prescription for you and say no go and secure the medicine. Meanwhile, you have come to seek help from a a government hospital which under our perspection as citizens of the country. We are hoping to see that when we get into a hospital 3/4 of the medicine, the treatment that is required must be provided by the government itself. First and foremost, we are looking at education and health. So my expectation from the national budget presentation I look to it that uh uh we expect more um assistive devices to do with education especially in disability sector particularly persons with albinism uh due to their eyes. Number two, we are looking at health health um issues pertaining to persons with albinism especially to their skin. So we we we really think that uh if this is uh added in the uh uh national budget, we we we think we are going to move uh in a right way with the protection of the government as well as um uh also we talk about uh transportation. So the the the national budget if it is also speaking on the transportation uh then that one is going to help because for everyone to move the transport so it's going to help to to enhance their capabilities. I want to see a good education to the people with albinismium. So activity support in terms of education. So uh because we we have challenges in sight. So our expectation as in eastern province as organizations of personities and personities in eastern province our expectation as follows. Um the firstly um we we are expecting uh increasing funding to disability programs. Um what I mean is like in eastern province um there there are only two offices for Zambia for persons with abilities which is a quas institution government institution which issues disability cards to persons with abilities. These are the same card that enables persons abilities to access social protection programs such as social cash transfer. So now because we have two offices only out of the 15 districts is uh very few persons abilities are accessing social cash transfer and other empowerment programs. Um so we expect that in the budget our expectation that uh these offices in each district in the province will have an office so that person abilities can make find it easier uh you know uh to register and to have a disability card. Uh the second issue we're expecting the minister of uh you know finance uh to have to address uh disability related costs when personities are moving from one place to another here in Zambia in terms of issues of transportation. Uh so we we we expect that uh uh government could you know respond uh by you know having policies around disability costs around transport. Then another issue that we're expecting, we're expecting that uh you know government uh uh should also uh uh you know um advise or maybe encourage you know the private companies uh private companies uh to employ you know persons with disabilities and uh should do that uh by sensitizing them on on issues of you know taxation. uh when it comes to youth empowerment so mostly uh according to what I've uh I've observed you find that uh it's more like they they focus mostly on us students like some of us were in who are in school so they should also consider those outside who have business ideas there are people who are not but they areed uh they've got skills and all that so also because they should be empowered. Uh I feel if more funds are directed in building more classroom blocks for the students will help in maintain the high quality of it of students. The government should do something about our school and also about the classrooms cuz we are facing a lot of challenges when it comes to like learning. Uh we know like in class most you are like over populated in class like we have less you know you have less space in class others have been opted to be standing outside through the windows and all that. So just board and you know look at all these angles that you actually facing at even one college at large. My expectations are that they invest more in quality education. For example, here at evening one, we have unfinished uh buildings. We also have more students than rooms. The accommodation is not that good. And for us like farmer students, we learn in labs. We don't have proper desk. We sit on those m tables where we use when making crafts. So I think in education they need to invest more so that they can fit the these buildings, build more classes and we need some desks and stuff like that. Hello. Hello. Hello. Regarding the expectations for the 2026 uh you know national budget which is going to be unveiled today by the minister of finance and national planning. The energy sector has been touched, health sector, education sector. People want to see more monies allocated to these sectors and many more. Now, person let's talk about uh the constituency development bank 2025 um there's an increment of 5.6 six uh billion meaning each constituency is getting to the 6.1 million and there's a lot that has been happening in this constituencies regarding you know projects in con development fund I know you guys 2 months ago I was in China you know province um almost uh 3 weeks ago just commissioning of constituency you know uh offices using uh CDL fans and um this is something that everybody's most of the people are actually excited about especially when you look at you know constituency officers most of them are being members of parliament are using you know the fans to actually build their own constituency you know officers using CDF the right honorable madam speaker has been on record um encouraging members of parliament to utilize CDF and construct um constituency offices because these are many parliaments in these various constituenc But when you go around in certain areas, that's where you find that most of these facilities are just random and people feel uncomfortable to visit these places. But the right honorable madam speaker has been on the floor of the house urging members of parliament to utilize city of component in um constructing um offices and the first one uh to be commissioned was like you've already put it uh 2 months ago and you could see how excited the local people were and the local authority because they are seeing their money working and constructing uh these purposes. I know in amazes constructed in as well not too long we should be seeing that office also being commissioned I think it's it's a good thing seeing that um the money the business money absolutely is working I'm sorry. Another constituent's office that's under construction is the one constituent office any time from now in a few months from now. We do expect the right honorable madam speaker to actually commission the constituency office. So I'm sure most follow suit and have their own constituency office. I think it is a huge challenge to other members of that again. Moa at some point something from their locality infrastructure from construction taking place in various looking what um the local people are benefiting in terms of schools. Mhm. The president is on not too long ago should be 2 years ago when he was talking about he never wanted to see any child sitting on the floor as they go to school because of CDF. seen quite a number of tests being um uh supplied in various uh conferences and again the plus on that parties using manufacturing business. Absolutely. So from 3.6 uh uh uh million each constituency 36.1 million I said 36.1 million each constituency we are yet to see how much you know is going to be allocated how much more is going to be allocated. Are you seeing an impact in terms of my 30? Wow, that's huge. Maybe 50% again. Uh let's wait and see. We can only expect that the minister will be here in a short while. Absolutely. So we moving on. We yet to speak to different you know guests that have been invited and members of parliament that are here to you know witness the unveiling of the 2026 national budget and one of our colleagues Martin actually did have a chat with Mr. Andrew Sun is a senior economist member of the Economics Association of Zambia and the association also have their own expectations in the 2026 uh national budget. Let's hear what You're watching Parliament Television. My name is Martina. On Friday 26th September 2025, the Minister of Finance and National Planning, Honorable Drs. Tum Soan MP will present the 2026 national budget. And so expectations are high as the budget serves as a platform for guiding Zambia's economic direction for the year ahead. And so to help us unpack some of these expectations, I'm joined by Economics Association of Zambia senior economist member, Mr. Andrew Sun who is here just to share with us what Economics Association of Zambia anticipates from the 2026 national budget presentation. Mr. Sun, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. Let me begin by asking from your economist member for what are your top expectations from the 2026 national budget presentation? the budget uh like you rightly put it, it's an economic policy document uh uh guiding uh economic policy for the next uh uh one year. So the expectations u are quite high. Uh number one um we I'm personally expecting um uh government to set a high uh growth economic growth uh uh target because the target has been around has been around 5 to 6%. But I'm uh expecting the government to be uh very aggressive and to be ambitious and uh targets around uh 10% because it's only when you have uh that high economic uh growth in excess of 10. you have those levels of growth that you will have a dent in terms of economic um uh impact in uh poverty uh promoting equality also uh reducing an uh employment and improving the well-being of the people. So it's a high growth that can uh a high growth of 10% that can uh result in a significant impact in uh those macroeconomic variables that I've alluded to. uh what kind of uh tax policies or incentives would you like to see introduced in this budget to support businesses and attract both local and foreign investment? The first thing that I would want to see is uh promotion of the local Zambia uh business person or the local uh theme. So in terms of um uh incentives, I expect the budget I think to give um uh policy guidelines in terms of uh reduction in the various uh uh fees that the small businesses are subjected um are subjected to. I think there's been uh a huge uh uh public outcry uh especially from the small businesses in terms of the fees that are levied on these uh businesses because most of these businesses are still uh in the infancy stage and they are yet to grow. So it's very critical that u the budget uh that to try and uh harmonize and reduce the fees for the for themes as far as incentives for the foreign um uh investors are concerned. uh I think uh what we currently have is u uh sufficient and there's been a lot of focus on uh foreign uh direct investment but it's very critical that we begin to aggressively uh promote the local businessman because growth that is significantly driven by the local businessman will have a greater impact as opposed to invest but every is we need to drive the agenda of the local the local. All right. And ensure national food security. Agriculture. The majority product that is maze. The majority of the maze is produced by the small scale scale uh uh farmers but uh as an inefficient uh way. So I would like this budget to have uh enhanced allocation in term of me and irrigation that's the small scale that is very u uh increase uh productivity and the yield per per field can be can be can be increased. Mr. How should the budget address issues of unemployment especially among young people or graduates who are entering the job market? Government alone uh cannot uh take on all the unemployed we we have. So what is critical to uh direct in terms of promotion of growth of the private sector? There's a not like I said the public sector cannot take on all the unemployed uh uh people. Thank you. All right. When it comes to this delivery in health and education, what key allocations or strategies could you expect the government to emphasize in the government? Emphasis should be uh on education. I expect an increased u uh allocation towards uh education especially in the area of um uh supporting our young uh people who are not able to afford to pay uh school fees on their own that is through the uh we I expect increase in allocation towards um uh the bazaries increased allocations towards uh uh skills development uh training so that we can have uh an educ educated uh uh sector of the economy. How can the budget encourage a culture of savings, investment and greater financial inclusion particularly for people in rural areas and uh small businesses? The uh savings and financial inclusion is very critical if you are to grow uh as a as a as as a business because it's very very important that uh every business uh participates in the uh in the financial sector. So I think what we've seen of late with uh mobile money transactions significantly increasing over the last uh uh uh 3 years I think that is a positive aspect with regards to financial inclusion and uh we expect to see uh the budget uh increased support in terms of promoting uh financial uh inclusion. Mr. As we come to the end of this interview, beyond short-term, what long would you like the 2026 budget to lay the foundation for in order to build a more resilient economy? So, we've got the eighth national uh development uh plan and then we've got the uh the medium-term u uh budget plan. So, I expect the budget to uh align to those um in the long term. Like I said in my uh preamble, we should uh see an increased uh support to the locals in terms of um uh promoting uh the locals in all the sectors be it mining, increased support to the artisan miners, be it in agriculture, increased support to the to the to the small scale uh uh farmers and then obviously um we've experienced uh certain challenges as a country with regards to uh energy. So in terms of the medium to longterm uh the budget should be seen to be uh addressing those energy because without any uh growth of an economy Mr. Sunen I would like to thank you so much for featuring on our program. Thank you very much. All right that was economics association of Zambia senior economist member Mr. Andrew Sun sharing insights and shedding light on the expectations ahead of the 2026 national budget present in national planning. Honorable MP will on my name is Martin Bura.

And these recruitments have a government to achieve a goal of ensuring that all health facilities have at least one qualified health personnel to ensure quality healthcare. And uh he did say that uh the increase in the number of front health workers has contributed to reduction in maternal and child mortality as um 82% of deliveries are conducted by personal due and um 2,000 again in the health sector being put this year. The number of recruitments that will take place in which sector that are going to be employed? Is it going to be doctors? Is it going to be nurses?

And uh that's the minister of finance and uh we also expect the speaker's position to make its way into the chamber in a few minutes uh from now and business uh will get started. And so we were just uh having a recap of uh the speech that the minister of finance did you know present in the 2025 national budget. Uh talking about energy that's uh you know one sector portion that everybody is talking about. uh we've been grappling with electricity issues and we know that exports um uh the the director at um the uh Zambia electricity supply corporation actually did say that uh you know exports of electricity have actually decreased to allow you know consumers here in the country to have you know more power that's one way of alleviating this you know power crisis that we are facing. The minister of uh energy was on the floor of the house rendering a ministerial statement and I'm sure he managed to put a smile on many Zambians because of uh the announcements that were made regarding the number of hours that uh people will be um having terms of uh electricity. So uh very expectant we await to hear uh what measures u the minister of finance or the don government has put in place to make sure that u the impact of uh load management is reduced. So uh that's the minister of finance just working majestically with a grand there uh going to do what Zambian have been uh looking forward to in terms of unveiling the 2026 uh national budget.

To this end, government will undertake legislative structural and policy reforms in a number of areas such as fiscal policy, domestic resources, resource mobilization, date management and um uh decentralization.

The remaining eligible VA taxpayers are required to register on the system by 30th September of this year will now will not recognize any invoice issued outside the system. My no government wants to maximize revenue collection. And not too long ago, members of parliament uh had a privilege uh to um be um uh oriented or being given an update by the Zambia Revenue Authority at Sienna Resort right here in Musaka where uh it was a tax symposium and how the government tends to um increase revenue collection from mine. So I I I'm looking forward to an update from the minister of finance in this year's um uh uh budget presentation. How many uh people have registered for smart invoice so that government can maximize revenue collection? That's the only way we see the economy boost and um have a better economy. Absolutely.

So depending on what areas we put that economic recovery in whether we're putting additional funds towards CC uh CDF and and obviously the credit guarantee scheme in terms of having to do to cover the recovery for the private sector. All right Caroline, your impression with regards to what is about to come um in our accountance in a few hours from now. That's right. Thank you, Brian. So, primarily for us, we're looking at a smart budget. I think the presentation should reflect that. And by smart budgeting, we are specifically talking about how you balance and leverage on some of the gains that we saw in as opposed to of course the social uh uh spending. It should not only reflect the income and expenditure. I think we need to move away from this and that is my expectation. And my expectation is to see how in as much as we are targeting certain key sectors when it comes to social protection and social sectors, we need to also be smart about it in terms of plowing back into the sectors that will enable us to grow this economy. I think to strike that balance it's very important because if you do not strike that balance you find yourself in a situation where majority of the allocation of the budget is going to consumption instead of production. What do I mean? We need to ensure that in as much as we are spending towards the consumer, the social sectors, I am hopeful and desirous to see that this budget presentation also puts enough resources into the very sectors that got us the economic gains that we're talking about currently. And these are sectors of course such as the mining sector. We're talking about the agriculture sector including the tourism sector. And a lot has been happening in these sectors. Not forgetting the energy sector which is the backbone of every other sector because every other sector cannot be sustained without energy. This is a given. So this is not to negate the fact that in as much as we're looking at such allocations, we also need to look at the allocations that will now go to things such as you know CDF and also we've seen cash for work. This is something that you know the government uh through the policy direction during the present during the address uh the parliamentary address by the head of state spoke to when it comes to the increment we saw a projected increase in the recruitment of health workers. We saw a projected increase of 2,000 additional teachers in the education sector. There is the homegrown feeding program. So all these yes we must be able to see uh money being put into these um uh projections but also we should not forget the fact that in as much as we are looking at the social sector and hoping for an increase in the social sector because this is where the micro is happening. This is where our people are directly benefiting from for example the inflation rates going down from the GDP projections of 6%. So we are desirous of seeing a smart budget in this case from the minister which puts all these things into uh consideration to ensure that we grow even at a faster rate than we consume as a country. All right, Matsung, thank you so much. And um I think for me it's a budget that's coming at a time when um the extended credit facility is expiring on the 25th of October and then there was that technical extension that was given to January 2026 and then there's a 12 month request that has to be looked at. So the question is from a primary surplus I mean primary uh surplus perspective what do we think the budget should look like anywhere maybe between 2 to 3% budget surplus uh it's also a budget that's coming at a time when Zambia just came out straight out of a drought 40 year uh the worst drought in 40 years um drought in itself like my fellow panelists have put on the table uh consequences within the energy sector. So we've seen reforms that happened this year, but the question is for some of those reforms to actualize, infrastructure is critical. For example, for open access to thrive, we need infrastructure, additional grid capacity. And I'm expecting to see an allocation towards building of infrastructure to accommodate the additional energy demands. We are looking at interconnectors. we should be able to connect with our neighbors that have excess power. Um on the petroleum side, I think there's been some positive pronouncements around us taking up stake within a loito refinery which is Angola. So not sure if this budget as well will have resources that will be channelneled towards us taking up that stake because it definitely needs to be funded. If it's going to be owned by the government, it has to be um funded. Uh let me talk about mining. I'm not expecting a lot within the mining space because uh most of what the mines uh were crying their bentleys over was already addressed in terms of double taxation and all that and we've already seen mining bearing fruit. But I talk about mining deliberately because Zambia has a target to hit 3 million metric tons. So obviously one of the macroeconomic targets would be to hit 3 million metric tons. But you can't mine without electricity and that's where the infrastructure uh uh piece then comes in. From an agriculture perspective, I'm expecting continuation of the comprehensive agriculture support program. That program should have been implemented sort of aggressively last this year. But then came drought. So I'm expecting that infrastructure, road networks, electricity access, building of dams just to build that resilience and to shift because comprehensive agriculture support program is now shifting agriculture from the demand side which was price fixing to the supply side which is now wealth creation. What we want is a farmer in Poro should start out as a peas and farmer and eventually graduate to a commercial farmer. But in a nutshell, the debt piece has already been ably covered by Trevor because uh we restructured debt which is a great thing but we now need to start servicing and then domestic debt is ballooning. So domestic debt areas need to be dealt with because that represents liquidity that the private sector is stopped. So I think it's a it's an interesting budget that we get clues from everything that has happened. the positives weighed against the negatives, but then it also completes a fiveyear cycle by the Ministry of Finance because we're talking about one year to an election. So, we're getting to a fiveyear cycle. So, the question is, it's a continuation of programs that already started, but then we just want to be clear about how they'll be funded. Lastly, from a taxation perspective, uh it's a very uncomfortable topic, but I do expect that there may be some adjustment on the taxation side to increase revenue because the government pur uh requires revenue. But the caution on the positive would be that if you look at the metrics in terms of public debt to GDP ratio, I think the projections from the IMF is that we close this year at just under 92 and then graduate to 79 and to 64 and that will be creating fiscal space. So it'll be interesting to see how those projection projections then fit into the budget because then we expect a little bit of fiscal space coming from um the Ministry of Finance. Listen, when you load down all these expectations right now, I don't I don't envy the the minister of finance. There's a lot of weight on his shoulders and in a few hours from now, you'll be appearing on your screens to give us what he has planned to spend in terms of the next financial year.

Now our first stop is the health sector. This is because this is a sector that is very critical in shaping the social economic development of the country with shocks from donor funding reduction. Pres speaks to some of the stakeholders on just what the expectations are from the budget presentation. The health sector is a cornerstone of Zambia's development as it plays a critical role in enhancing quality of life for citizens, strengthening communities and ensuring a stable social economic environment. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that investments in healthcare is not merely an expenditure, but rather a foundational element for sustainable economic productivity. Stakeholders like the Zambia Medical Association are at the forefront for advocating for improved healthcare. Dr. Masopiri, president of the Zambia Medical Association, highlights the association's budget expectations for the year 2026. The Zambia Medical Association first and foremost commends the new Dawn government for its consistency in uh increasingly allocating resources towards the health sector uh for the four years they have been in their reign and so our expectation is that even in 2026 there will be an increase in their allocation towards the same as they have been progressively doing. This is commendable as it shows um a direct commitment to the health sector budget. The pharmaceutical industry plays a vital role in ensuring access to essential medicines. Keegan M, president of the pharmaceutical association. He's hopeful that the budget will allocate more funds to further enhance accessibility to medicines. Our expectations in the budget is that um number one we expect an increase in the drug budget. Currently we are standing at 4.9 billion uh which is not enough especially that uh we've been supplemented by uh donors who have been giving us uh more than 5 billion u per year and when we put this together it means that we've been running on a budget of 10 billion. So this time around we want uh our budget to be locally generated and planned for everything. Nurses are the backbone of Zambia's healthcare system. F Melo, president Zambia Union of Nurses and Midwives organization acknowledges the recruitment process as one of the biggest gains last year. He is optimistic that this trajectory will continue when funding is increased to the health sector. There's a lot actually that uh would happen to the health sector such as it would it would enhance the welfare of all aspects of uh health workers in this country specifically the nurses and midwives and also enhancing the service uh delivery. As the finance and national planning minister Dr. Stobe Sokoani presents the budget to the nation, stakeholders have their eye on increased allocations for the sector's growth and development depends on strategic budget allocations. Best reporting. Thank you. Now colleagues I'd like to bring you in at this particular time and when we talk about the health sector uh we know for a fact that there was some news in May that was very devastating with the US cutting 50 million that's about 1.4 4 billion quatcher in in annual and you know annual aid provided to Zambia for medications and medical supplies the impact of this development extremely grave on the current budget so there's a void that needs to be filled by this case resources right now if you in the shoes of the minister how would you play around that that that quagmire so to speak very interesting position um firstly in terms of the health sector obviously is that it speaks to the health of everybody in the country and um it is one of the key areas in which we allocate funding from our budget. Um but it is important you remember you must understand that in terms of resource allocation there are a lot of competing needs and if you ask anybody everybody wants an increase in that area and I think the first area that we must obviously start from is that obviously recognize the fact that there's there's there's a deficit that we are facing because of the the withdrawal of the deh of the uh donor funding and this will require to be covered. So whatever that portion is is that the minister would require to be able to allocate these funds to cover that deficit. Um but it means that it it has to be taken from somewhere else where that need is and and um last year is that the health sector got 23 billion quatcher in terms of the 2025 budget uh which was 10 point 10 10% of the overall budget. So essentially is that you'll expect um this increase to continue. The interesting aspects that you do see is that yes we had an increase in terms of the budget to 217 but um the actual value of the budget didn't actually increase because if you're using the nominal value of the dollar is that the budget actually reduced slightly in 2025. Although it changed the dynamics when we had the supplementary budget that it went to 259 but essentially is that you would expect that they will at least increase the 50 million that was withdrawn from the donor funds. All right. Do you think this is going to see an increase in terms of the I mean obviously it's going to be an increase in terms of the whole budget because we've got the elections coming to the four but do you think also that developments that unfolded in the health sector in this budget will compel the minister of finance to again increase the budget further? I I think so. I I totally agree with that assession and the reason for this um is very simple. Uh we have a deficit currently because of the shock that we suffered when the donor funded um or the donor input was withdrawn. I must just also put it on record here to say that I think it is also uh a blessing in disguise so to speak. For the longest as a country, we've depended so much on donor funding when it comes even with issues of health. And I think this is something that will give us um that impetus to begin to look within our own resources and plan our resources to cut for the gap that we are seeing currently. And so what it is now to put it plainly and simply is that we had a budget previously that was supplemented by the donor funding and currently out of that equation is that funding that we were expecting year in year out and moving forward we are saying that there has to be that gap filling of that deficit that we are facing. And so in in in simple terms, yes, the minister has to of course um explain to us Zambians and stakeholders where this money will come from in terms of mobilization of resources to be able to bring us at par in terms of where we were before the deficit. in terms of an increment I'm thinking it would be a bit uh of a push or pushing it uh in terms of how he plays around with the resources looking at the competing needs that are out there. So right now what we are hopeful or what we are looking to see is if we cannot do anything else at least let us bring us to speed in terms of where we were at before the the deficit before the pulling out of the donor funding and if anything it would be good to see an increase in terms of what you asked me uh there's been so much that has been happening in the health sector and this is not in isolation. We've seen the creation of so many health centers and with health centers of course comes with um a lot of nurses in terms of manpower health workers and there's already a projection of 2,000 additional uh health workers. Uh so of course again we're looking at uh issues to do with the quality of health that our people will be receiving and this just does not just end with uh the health worker themselves. We're talking about equipment and machinery and of course the medicines. But also I'd like to just mention here in terms of how um this budget will reflect the the strengthening of uh the system the health system when it comes to pilerage of medical supplies because it's like you're making so much progress but at the end of the day you have holes in a bucket and there's so much leakage when it comes to public resources being prudently utilized. So primarily we expect to see that that uh increase in terms of maintaining uh the the the the resources uh but if we could do better that would be good to see in terms of the trajectory that the government has taken. All right Mungi I'll bring you in to talk about you know um economic um growth and economic recovery. Um and obviously we blend in the issue of the mining sector which now is back on its wheels and we just wonder to what extent that's going to impact the budget and the resource mobilization as far as the country is concerned. Don't forget we've got an audience with us in the studio when we're talking about about health. I noticed you guys got a bit concerned. Uh is anybody willing to give us their thoughts regards this sector and what you expect as far as the budget is concerned? Um there's a microphone there. Yes, my name is Don't worry that microphone is in the budget. All right. Yeah, my name is Sam. What I expect from this from this budget is the health sector is not doing very well currently and uh we need new medication in terms of we need the budget for for for the for this for this for this year supposed to for next year is supposed to increase in terms of medical facilities are not at par with the economy which we we are on. All right. And uh moreover the the the GDP is increasing and the population is increasing. So the health sector is supposed to to provide for for those who are going to be suffering from sickness and mental health and also the the government is supposed to to provide for mental mental health for students and these youngster who are coming up. So I'm looking forward to to the increase in med medical in health sector in terms of medicines and personnel also. All right. Oh, thank you very much. We'll get more of those, you know, thoughts from you as we progress with the program. Let's take a short break. When we get back, we'll be biting our teeth in economic growth and economic recovery. And of course, we will look in the mining sector and other, you know, sectors that go with growth and economic recovery. Stay with us.

Let's get to the country's um you know, major um um wealth earners, so to speak, the mining sector. And as you know that there's been a lot of you know happening as far as that is concerned and um our staffer you know severe was sitting down with the mine unions on the copper belt and they are saying the budget needs to have more funding to the ministry of labor uh to address some of the challenges facing the labor movement such as safety and decent wages. entrusted with it is the time for the 226 budget presentation and the expectations are high on the copper belt. The mine unions have put in what they want to see in the budget. Tax regimes or increase in some taxes that should be pronounced. They must also be able to to be job protective. shouldn't be policies that or taxes that will come to warranty dismiss of of workers. What would want to see in the budget is supportive values in terms of like the minister of labor which is our ministry. We have had a lot of new investors that have come on board but we have seen inadequates in terms of outreach of our officers in terms of the labor ministries. But what about the dollar and this chamber of commerce and the industry? We anticipate that funding for health and education will continue to rise. We would also like to see budget provision to mitigate the risk of climate shocks. Additionally, more investment in mining exploration and infrastructure to help reach the 3 million ton copper production target. I also had a chat with some economic experts on what the 20.6 budget should look like. We've seen turnover tax going up last steadily for last five six years. Initially it was to 3% after a bit of time it went to 4%. Last year it went it went up to 5%. So it' be it'd be good to see some relief on that front. Programs which have largely contributed to the economic growth in um in in the year of 2025 should be not only doubled down but um increased and that's where most of the focus should be like the 1 million farmers in the farmer input support system and the deaf community also gave their take on the 2026 budget. So in the budget line for 2026, we would want to see more person with disability be employed and also the sector of employment we should also endeavor that we include more who who who are channeled to to to speak to the plight of person with disability news gateway some tax relief taxes in this I'd like to get your impression with regards to the mining sector. Lots of talking points come from there. the mining sector is now back on its wheels. Um you just wonder what what is going through you know the mind of the minister as far as ensuring that this sector is pumped up so to speak. Okay. So yes the mining sector is in boom phase right now and if you look at production year on year I think half year we're looking at four 436,000 metric tons and that's obviously on track to just hitting a million metric tons by the end of the year. It's a critical phase because on one end the environment is conducive, production is going up, investments are trickling in. If you go onto Kafu road almost every day, you will see heavy machinery and all that is going towards the copper belt of Africa. When production goes up married with the prices of base metals on the London metro exchange, that's a good thing because then you look at your mining revenues and everything is booming. The interesting thing about mining is that when mining booms downstream business because there are businesses that are dependent on mining and that's why they call mining uh Zambia's golden hedge against global volatility. So yes it's booming and some of the targets that Zambia set may be aggressive but pretty much um achievable but it also comes with its own uh undertones. So mining is a sector that is wide. You have artisanal miners as well that are pushing in one direction and they feel that they've been dubbed illegal miners and they would like a conducive environment for them to thrive because you start from anme and then gradually you graduate into a corporate. So these are some of the things that are going to be looking at how do how does government then formalize and create uh a structure that will accommodate artisano mining for the big mines. Yes, there have been a number of plagues. We are seeing them actualize. And um if you put your eye on Zambia, you'll realize that there's something happening in the world that most people uh are not paying attention to. We've got the electric car era. There's renewable energy. There's artificial intelligence which everybody's not talking about. If I take you to the US, there's a Stargate program $500 billion. What that entails is that they're going to build data centers. Data centers are energy intensive and they require copper and that's why you will see a string of investors coming to court Zambia. Just this week you had finances and FQM meeting the president. Why do you think global bankers would fly from one corner of the world to the other? is because they're positioning themselves for this revolution that is about to take place and Zambia and DRC are at the center of it and that's why you see that on the eastern side you've got Tazara which is being revamped at a billion dollars on the western side you have loito corridor on the issues that speak to mind safety those are very critical we can't compromise uh compromise and because we are in this E and S era where it's environmental social you can't have pollution uh and and not preserve nature capital. So the expectations are what is government going to do? What are we going to see in terms of allocation in terms of fines that they will introduce to uh mitigate some of those other risks. Um the other job concerns are things that year in and year out have always been there. And look um I think it's always critical to look after staff. I won't dwell so much on that because it's the nitty-g gritties of the operating environment of each and every entity. But in a nutshell, I would say there's a boom. It's definitely supporting growth and it's a wave we must not miss because copper is flirting with highs of $10,000 a metric ton. We can't afford to miss this because that is where the cash flow to service debt to pay for those se sectors that people are anticipating increases and put the government in a position where its fiscal purse is adequate enough to allocate resources adequately uh in in in in key sectors and and drive the economic agenda. For that to happen, you need policies that ensure that Zambia stands in a place where it benefits. a great deal from this boom in in terms of the need of copper on the global economy, isn't it? Yes. Yes, Brian, you absolutely do. And um just maybe to speak to some of the stakeholder um outcomes that we saw just now, we need to as a country be able to appreciate the very fact that yes, the mining sector is a big one for us. It's a Qashqa. That is where our resource base uh mainly resides. And so we're talking about of course issues of taxation here and and I I I know for a fact that I think it will be detrimental to overt tax in a way because in the end you'll find situations where most of the mining uh companies will not be able to operate uh in in what would make business sense and at the receiving end of such an eventuality are the Zambian people those that are employed within the mines. So we need to strike a balance and the government needs to strike a balance when it comes to how we can leverage this sector which at this you know point in time is performing at its optimum. Of course there's you know reason to improve there's room to improve but looking at the prices you know um global market prices when it comes to our mineral and the demand in itself and also looking at all the policies and you know initiatives that have gone into the mining sector starting 2021 when it comes to reopening of mines and also the target that we're looking at in terms of higher production of co we need to begin to explore other avenues other than just the the taxing aspect I think we need to look that value addition. I think that one is very key. Uh also we need to look at supporting the locals in a big way and I think um this sentiment resonates with what one of the the the speakers just from the vox swap we've seen now was talking about in terms of labor issues. I think it is important that we go back to the drawing board. I know for a fact that uh you know just after independence when the mines were being run we saw towns develop on the premise of the mines themselves. We would like to see that robust um you know uh prosperity come back to the towns and cities where these mines are operating. And how do we do this? We need to have deliberate and robust policies in terms of how the mining sector gives back to their communities. And this is not just in in terms of employment. We're looking at in terms of supply of of goods and commodities that the mines require. I think it is important that we are more deliberate and we expect the government to ensure that policies are directed in such a way that the mining owners, the business owners in the mines are deliberate when it comes to uh sourcing of um goods and services to benefit the local people. Okay. Trevor, briefly before you get talk about the issue of the energy sector, your comment regards to the mining sector. Should we, you know, um, upscale the tax regime when it comes to the mining sector, you think? Um, so firstly, I think there's always been an issue that we've had as a country around how much tax we're generating from the mining sector and especially from...",

         "US Slaps Zambia & Malawi With $15,000 Visa Bond — Is This Fair?",
         "The U.S. has just imposed a controversial $15,000 visa bond on travelers from Zambia and Malawi. Many are calling it discriminatory and unfair, while others say it’s about tightening U.S. immigration rules.\nWhat does this mean for Africans who want to travel? And why are countries like Zambia and Malawi being targeted?\nIfy Igwe reports on the U.S. visa bond policy and its impact on African nations.",
         "Тексты с изображений\r\nvifsia s15k for 7.4. afnican u.s. visa sc\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:$15,000 is no joke. And when the US starts requesting that from you in order to be let into their country, then you know it's time to actually develop your own country some more. There's this quiet storm brewing and it's hitting two African nations first, Malawi and Zambia. So, the United States government has just announced a policy that directly targets citizens from these two countries, and it seems so absurd. It requires them to pay visa bonds of up to $15,000 just to enter the US on a tourist visa. $15,000 just to visit, not for business, but to visit. Now the official narrative is that this move is meant to discourage visa overseas. But we must ask why start with Malawi and Zambia, two small peaceful nations with relatively low travel volumes to the US. Let's just break this down a step further. So according to the US Department of State, this new policy is part of a 12 month pilot program aimed at countries whose citizens allegedly overstay their visas at higher rates. Right. And this is effective August 20th. Citizens of Malawi and Zambia applying for a tourist visa will be required to pay a bond ranging from $5,000 to $15,000. Think about it. If they leave the US before their visa expires, they get the money back. If they overstay or apply for asylum, the US government keeps the money. But where did they even get that amount of money from in the first place? Let's look at the actual numbers. So in 2023, only 1,655 people from Malawi and 3,493 people from Zambia entered the US for tourism or business. Of these people, just 237 Malawians and 388 Zambians overstayed their visas. Social media has been filled with so many opinions, right, about this with some people comparing those figures to 20,811 Brazilian overstays and over 40,000 from Colombia and asking why those countries aren't being slapped with such demands and bonds, at least not yet. So again, they ask, is the US targeting small African nations first? What happens to the students, to the professionals who are lawful travelers who already jump through hoops just to secure a visa interview? Now they're being asked to produce up to $15,000 not for entry, but as a security deposit for their intentions. Where do where do they get that amount of money from? It's pretty much telling them don't come here. There are also different African social media forums debating this recent news and they're saying that this move isn't about national security that it is about power, it's about profit and profiling. What do you think about? Do you think they're they're correct? So here's my thing. You need to understand something. This is the power of sovereignty. Every sovereign nation has the right to want their country the way they want. So, we can't be mad at that, especially when they're doing it for the best interests of their nation, right? So, we we just can't be mad. The Council on American Islamic Relations called this particular move a legalized shakeddown. Their spokesperson, Robert Macar, said, and I quote, \"This is not about national security. It's about weaponizing immigration policy to exort vulnerable visitors, to punish disfavored countries, and to turn America's welcome mat into a payw wall. Is he right? What are your thoughts? Drop your thoughts in the comment section. We can't help but point out that to an extent, this is how systems of global inequality may operate. Not just through bombs or borders, but through bureaucracy. bureaucracy like this through policies and through such fees that price out black and brown people from so-called land of opportunity. For many Africans, travel is already a financial and emotional burden for them. Visa application fees, flights, accommodation and now this like I mentioned this is the power of sovereignty. Every country has a right to do what they want. This could be seen as cruel because it also affects people that are playing by the rules, the students, the people who are going in for business and wanting to come back to their country. The people that are applying legally. Some people have called this postc colonial prejudice. It's a tough one, but like I mentioned, every country has the right to do just that. You can't tell any country how to run its affairs, their house, their rules. But what are your thoughts about this? Do you think it's a bit harsh? And what should the next move be for Malawi and Tanzania? You know, in global politics, there's something called reciprocity. These African nations have every right to retaliate. After all, the US also has interests in their country. So, they have to be bold enough to play the game of global politics. It's all about leverage, right? It's about having that leverage. Africa will always have natural resources that the west always needs and that that in itself is massive leverage and they can use that as a leverage. Africa must learn to use what it has to get what it needs. Africa is awakening but we should awaken some more. Malawi and Zambia must rise some more. They must ensure that they own their power and they are able to and they are bold enough to stretch the the influence of their power because so far you have leverage based on the natural resources that you have. People also have to play by your rules. The world is watching. What are your thoughts about this? My name is Ephie reporting from Nigeria. This is the Africa Diaspora News Channel. We'll see you on the next story.\r\n",

Let's join together and welcome the rest television audience social media platforms. Those on our social handles, please type and say, \"Pastor, I am with you. I don't mind the distance you are from here. By no grace is sufficient on you to tap in the grace upon this in the name of Jesus Christ son of the living God. Somebody hold. Amen. Your amens are minimal at least. Every time I come, I have a question. I question myself. Why do you come in this place? Why do you come repeatedly, [Music] month after month, week, week after week? year after year. If it is not God, woman and gentlemen who can keep you in one place, [Applause] if it is God who causes you to come, clap your hands and scream for him. Hallelujah. [Applause] It shall come to pass as it is written in Psalm 84 verse number seven to them that went before God went from power into power. Each one of them appeared before God inside. Thou shall sift from power to power. [Music] I speak of the grace in this place. You are like a phone brought for charging. I pray you won't leave the Sabbath without a next BH. Let me say again. Except you have not switched over. I have never been angry like I got when I I think I have plugged in and switched on and yet you have not switched on. You wait for the whole hour and you come to take away your phone and the phone say battery is low. How many of you have ever experienced it? I speak to you today. You want to leave the service. So make sure. So make sure that you are plugged in and switched on because it said in Hebrews 11:6 11:6 of Hebrews it says but without faith it is very impossible to please the Lord God because for he who comes before God They must believe that he is here. [Music] I make a decree to you. My seeking won't be in vain. It doesn't matter when you will boast in your seeking God. It doesn't matter how long. There shall be a vivid distinction. Time of your lunch you invested in God. These are the reason that is the how that those are the land. This is the is the victory screaming to shout amen. I am here believing that God is in this and he's a reward of us who seek him. Anybody seeking God this make a joyful noise [Music] of the Lord. Someone is about to open with the intentional [Music] verses 130 the entrance of your word. It gives life entrance of it causes the simple to understand. in a few minutes. [Music] You're brought to have light. You're brought to have understanding. And after your understanding, my life will never be the same. Say it again. After I have received understanding, my life will never be on the same bar. Those who are educated are not like those who are not educated. The illiterate and illiterate have a distinction. I decree the name of the Lord. You have to have life. Are you there? Hallelujah. Shout hallelujah if you are there. I make a decree to you. This is where we get to know. There is nothing new under the sun. Do you know that it is only God who has new things because he's the one who saying that they see I do something new will you not see will you not know about it I am prophesying everything that has been anything old that was Amen. Do I have those who love God? Do you have anyone who loves God in this place? I expect to qualify to see new things. [Music] Isaiah 43:19, he said, \"Behold, behold, behold, I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall you not know about it, even I will make a road in the wilderness?\" Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [Music] I'll put rivers in the desert. I decree you every man and woman has understood for God is about to do something new. [Music] In verse number 26, rivers in the desert, rivers in the desert, I decree to you that wilderness will have springs of water. that wilderness. My good lord. [Music] Those who love God here. What eyes have never seen ear? God is releasing them to you today. 1 Corinthians 2:9 said as it is written what eyes has not seen nor ears heard that which has which has never entered into any man's hand. These are the very things God has prepared. Those who come for lunch hour [Music] what no man has ever seen. Think about it. There's something they have never seen in my family. [Music] He has prepared them for you. He has prepared them for you. Do you know why he has done so? Because you love him. Today we're going to pray. We are going to pray today. No more testimonies. What is it? There is a testimony that will come out of your already started testifying. Have your seat for 120 seconds. Yes. Yes. The Lord is good. You know, hallelujah. And a man shouting pays not a bill. But they that screams after they pay the bills and God blesses them. is saying thou shall have money. I'm not saying because you bring 10,000 you will have money. You're going to be great. You're going to be very distinct. There shall be clear distinction upon your life. Money is going to come. This is my prayer. Don't become crazy when money comes in. Don't be confused. God is going to help you. You will get to a level of having money which you cannot count for. [Music] I can never forget those days where I could go back in the pockets of my trousers to check the coin the man I have left there but you check and you don't even find a coin but these days as you're there someone tells Papa, this $1,000 was left somewhere here. [Music] That is clapping, looking at me forett,00 How can I forget a million in my wallet, my pocket, and I forget that I have it? for getting money. Nobody should help you. As if you have nevered the entire campa [Music] which has never entered no man's heart. God has prepared them for you. And you know I tell you and you you think I'm feeling myself. I'm telling the truth because I'm I'm born again. I have built more than 10 buildings, but I have never built the one which is on stor. I want to ask these people who build down on the earth houses. How how do you do? I'm just asking down on earth houses. I want to ask how do you do it? Cuz when we are in the sunny season, when the sun is scorching, I tell people when in the night you feel that heat. What about this one? It's breaking around. Take the same anointing. How can I spend all this and it doesn't come to you? Impossible. [Music] [Music] He will build and I've also discovered this one. I I don't do it intentionally. While I am building I'm constructing this one. I'm also constructing another. I build it two at once. How do you do it? That's what they call. [Music] It may start with those who believe that before you leave the earth you will be destroyed then we will create the normal overed upon people's lives the [Music] I received the freely. Good Lord. [Music] That is grace. [Music] You told it to friend. You told it to. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] That's [Music] [Music] [Music] Somebody speak of the grace you are. Are you taking speaking? Take the grace. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Foreign [Music] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] [Music] I've come [Music] so [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are in the time of giving 2025. I release this grace to you. [Music] I release it to you. You know Friday is only a joking subject as you were giving. You hear testimony. Yes. Never stay the same. Some of you leave me here and find me here. But I'm returning the pastor. I release the kiss people in his cities. you I'm fasting I'm saved and I'm our being in this place for us to be in this place every 30 days we use 60 million. But even myself, I ask where does this money? How about that which we give? If I can tell you to count this money here, you will say that guy is loaded up in the same place I position myself. The God has kept us in the city. Let him release the grace to sit upon your life. Nobody will exit out of the I'll never leave the city because I'm because I'm in love because I'm because things are [Music] [Applause] never push you by the head of and say get out of the city because you failing everything is upon you and hear me well because I see people coming to give when they folding their what are they on Hold the seat and put it here.

I say repeatedly, Solomon saw a slagant, he made him hungry, and before him was a power full of food. He placed his hand into here. Proverbs 19:24, a lazy man his hand in the power and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. Food was too heavy for him for you. How can you receive such revelation? You bring your one yet. I am being a priest here at the altars. They say you're leaving the city. Can I show you the world and its curse is warming up for you. He said the way you came the way you exist 5:15.

         "Tanzania has condemned the resurgence of violations of international law, a trend that encourages the use of force as a means of resolving disputes.\nThe country stated that such practices not only undermine global efforts to maintain peace and security but also endanger the lives of innocent civilians in conflict-affected areas.\nIt emphasised that the use of force has become a source of human rights abuses, particularly affecting children, women, the elderly, and the sick.\nThese remarks were made by Vice President Dr Philip Mpango during the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States.\nSpeaking on behalf of President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Dr Mpango highlighted that this weakening of international norms is driven by imperialistic attitudes, including the perception of Africa as a target for resource exploitation and land grabs.\nHe added that multinational corporations continue to thrive by exploiting Africa’s natural resources, often causing or supporting conflicts, a situation that must end immediately.",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Our planet often reveals landscapes that blur the line between reality and illusion. [Music] There are places so strange they seem to exist only in dreams, yet they stand real on Earth. Here, nature acts like a surreal artist shaping visions beyond imagination. [Music] Those who arrive are not only amazed by the beauty but also reminded of their smallalness in the vast universe. [Music] And now let us embark on a journey to discover unreal places that unbelievably truly exist around us. [Music] Old man of store in Scotland is a bassalt pillar about 160 ft tall created after surrounding softer rocks collapsed and eroded. [Music] The process took millions of years, leaving a hard rock column that stands alone and can be seen from far away. [Music] Its main material is volcanic bassalt showing evidence of ancient tectonic and eruptive activity in the highland region. [Music] The nearby area preserves signs of large landslips, allowing scientists to study weathering and geological change. [Music] [Music] Its vertical form and unusual shape made it a popular subject for photography and international film productions. [Music] with notable height, long geological history and clear formation. Old man of store is regarded as a unique natural landmark of Scotland. [Music] [Music] Vinton Gosorn. [Music] Army. [Music] Montasaria [Music] [Music] for [Music] speech. foreignolog. [Music] Ou [Music] Nika mine in Mexico is famous for containing the world's largest selonite crystals with some more than 35 ft long and weighing many tons. [Music] These crystals formed when mineralrich groundwater was heated by magma deep underground and crystallized over hundreds of thousands of years. [Music] The cave environment is extremely harsh with temperatures above 130 and nearly saturated humidity making research very difficult. [Music] Inside the mine looks like a natural crystal palace where giant columns of selonite intersect through the chamber. [Music] Nika mine is both an active mining site and a major geological discovery proving the creative power of nature. [Music] The liquid rainbow in Colombia is called the most beautiful river in the world because of a very rare natural color changing phenomenon. [Music] [Music] Red, yellow, green, black, and pink appear most clearly in the transition period between rainy and dry seasons when the water level is clear and balanced. [Music] The strange colors come from a unique aquatic plant called macarinia clavagera that grows on rocks at the bottom of the river. [Music] Oh, [Music] when sunlight shines down the mix of clear water and plant pigments creates the bright effect of a flowing rainbow. The river passes over rock layers and small waterfalls, making the scenery more dynamic and unusual. [Music] The liquid rainbow is not only a unique natural wonder but also a national symbol showing the harmony of geology, climate and special ecosystems. [Music] Navajo beach in Greece is famous for the panotaas shipwreck lying on the white sand forming a distinctive mark within the natural landscape. [Music] The beach is surrounded by white cliffs nearly 650 ft high, creating total isolation and allowing access only by sea. [Music] The seawater has a rare bright blue color produced by sunlight reflecting through white limestone at the bottom creating a clear optical effect. [Music] The contrast of white sand, high cliffs, and blue water has shaped a striking and iconic scene. [Music] Geological landslides and natural deposition continually renew the sand, preserving the beach's unique features. [Music] Navajo Beach is notable not only for its unusual beauty, but also as clear evidence of the interaction between geology, marine environment, and human impact. [Music] Monttera is one of the oldest mountains on Earth formed around 2 billion years ago during the pre-Camrian period. [Music] Its summit is flat like a giant altar covering nearly 12 square miles and surrounded by vertical cliffs over 1,300 ft high. It is made of rare tapoui sandstone slowly eroded by acid rain and strong wind over millions of years. [Music] Many natural lakes on the summit hold ancient bacteria, helping scientists study the early evolution of life. [Music] Monte Rima inspired the novel The Lost World with the idea of a land completely isolated from the outside [Music] located at a triber point. The mountain is mostly in Venezuela and seen as a sacred cultural symbol by native people and popular literature. [Music] Sotra Island in Yemen is called an otherworldly island and is famous for a unique ecosystem with more than 1/3 of plants found nowhere else. [Music] The island split from the mainland about 20 million years ago, allowing independent evolution and preserving many ancient features. [Music] Its emblem is the dragon blood tree with an inverted umbrella crown and dark red resin valued in biology and culture. [Music] Historical records note the resin was used for dye medicine and ritual writing showing long use across civilizations [Music] during windy seasons. The sand forms ridges and the trees twist in the wind, creating a moving and surreal landscape [Music] [Music] for its special geology and biology. The island is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site and a key place for biodiversity research. Behringer Crater in the United States was formed about 5,000 years ago when an iron nickel meteor about 150 ft wide struck Earth at high speed. [Music] [Music] The impact released energy equal to 10 megat tons of TNT melting rocks and throwing debris for miles. [Music] [Music] The crater measures about 3,900 ft across and nearly 600 ft deep, surrounded by a rim about 150 ft high, forming a nearly perfect circle. [Music] Many iron nickel fragments remain around the site containing rare minerals valuable for research. [Music] Behringer Crater was even used by NASA to train Apollo astronauts and today stands as a natural laboratory showing cosmic power striking our planet Lenso Marinensus National Park in Brazil. spans about 600 square miles and is famous for thousands of white dunes stretching like a giant sheet. [Music] Although it looks like a desert, the region receives heavy rainfall filling valleys between dunes with countless temporary lakes. [Music] During the rainy season, the lakes appear crystal clear, some reaching dozens of feet deep, reflecting brilliant shades of blue and turquoise. is [Music] Fish and small creatures survive because their eggs remain dormant in the And until water returns [Music] [Music] dunes rising up to 130 ft are reshaped constantly by strong winds. s making the landscape shift every season. [Music] Today, Lansois Marinenses is recognized as one of Brazil's most striking natural wonders. is [Music] Sir Vakvaten, also known as Lake Lightvaten, is the largest freshwater lake in the Farro Islands, measuring about 3 mi long and 1.3 square miles in area. [Music] The lake was formed during the ice age and sits close to the ocean yet about 100 ft higher than sea level. [Music] This elevation difference together with the horizon creates a famous optical illusion making the lake appear to float hundreds of feet above the Atlantic. [Music] Water from the lake exits through a dramatic waterfall that drops directly from steep cliffs into the ocean. Surrounding cliffs rise several hundred ft, contrasting the calm surface of the lake with the rough waves below. Today, Svag Vatin serves as both an important freshwater source and one of the most photographed natural landmarks in the Farro Islands. [Music] Pamocale in Turkey is called the cotton castle is world famous for its white travatine terraces formed by calciumrich springs over thousands of years. Small tiered pools hold turquoise water contrasting with the pure white stone and creating a surreal and unique landscape. Continuous mineral deposits reshape the travatine surface over time, making the formation dynamic and always changing. The entire slope shines white and from afar looks like a giant snowy mountain standing in a dry land. Since Roman times, the site has been used as a retreat and healing area with beliefs that mineral water could benefit health. Today, Pamokale is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site valued for its geology and as one of Turkeykey's outstanding natural wonders. [Music] Kawa Een in Indonesia is the only place on Earth with natural blue fire visible at night glowing like streams of neon blue lava. The effect happens when sulfuric gases escape from volcanic vents, meet oxygen, and ignite, producing bright blue flames. [Music] [Music] The crater also holds the largest acid lake on the planet, about 0.6 6 square miles in size with a pH close to zero strong enough to corrode metal. [Music] Its water shines bright turquoise but is extremely acidic, showing a rare contrast between beauty and danger. [Music] Thick sulfur steam rises around the vents, smelling like rotten eggs, and can burn skin or lungs without protective masks. [Music] Kawa Ain is both a unique natural wonder and a clear reminder of Earth's harsh and mysterious forces. [Music] Victoria Falls is one of the largest and most powerful waterfalls on Earth with a height over 350 ft and a width close to 1 mile forming a massive wall of water. [Music] During the rainy season, it can carry over 15,000 gallons per minute, creating a thick mist cloud visible from more than 12 m away. Locals call it moi oatuna, meaning the smoke that thunders because of the roaring sound and columns of spray rising hundreds of feet into the air. [Music] What makes Victoria Falls unique is its vertical drop from a flat rock ledge. Unlike most waterfalls that follow a mountain slope, [Music] the flow appears suddenly sliced from the land, creating a dramatic illusion as if the river disappears into the void. [Music] It is a place where sound, mist water, and light come together to form one of nature's greatest spectacles. [Music] Petra in Jordan was carved directly into red sands\r\n",

         "Meet Sims Patton, a PhD candidate at The George Washington University doing her research out of Gombe Stream Research Center in Tanzania! 🤩🔍\n🌿🐵 Gombe Stream Research Center is where Dr. Jane Goodall began her work in 1960. Though her interest in primates started young, Sims's Gombe journey began decades later in 2021, when she joined the Primate Behavioral Ecology Lab at The George Washington University.\n🌳📊 Now a fifth year PhD candidate, Sims recently completed her first field season at Gombe, officially marking her name in the Gombe record forever! She also gathered some pretty exciting stories, including a few run-ins with siafu, otherwise known as safari ants. 🐜\n🧐💭 Looking ahead to the future of Gombe research, Sims wonders how climate change will impact chimpanzee habitat and behaviors: \"Will temperature and rainfall impact the fruit trees there? Will the chimps resort to eating more fallback foods like leaves and grasses?” We're counting on Gombe researchers like Sims to keep seeking answers to these questions! 🌟\nMeet more of Gombe's researchers on our blog >> https://news.janegoodall.org/2025/07/11/voices-of-gombe-a-network-of-impact/\n📸 credit: Sims Patton\n#Gombe #ChimpanzeeResearch #ChimpanzeeConservation #Primatology #ChimpanzeeBehavior #PrimateBehavior #Researcher",

Cuz I see you already in the weekend for you. You are ahead of us already. Yeah, it is what it is. She's already ahead of us. I know, right? you just come and see something. All right, you're welcome to the news headline review. So, let's dive straight into our major news items for this morning. Education Ministry rolls out PTAs nationwide with new guidelines. The Ministry of Education has announced nationwide rollout of parent teacher associations under a new framework designed to strengthen collaboration between schools and families. The announcement followed the submission of final policy guidelines on the operationalization of PTAs developed by the National Curriculum Review Committee. Education Minister Haruna urged parents and teachers to work together to improve learning outcomes, stressing that education is a shared responsibility. He said PTAs are back. Now there is an established norm with guidelines to facilitate and support their work. Socialization is a shared responsibility particularly for young learners while the child spends time at home. Significant hours are spent in school making both parents and teachers equally responsible for shaping the child. Ghana's concept of socialization must be shared. Chairman of the committee on the guidelines, Kofi Assari, emphasized that PTAs must play an active role in school level decision making rather than being seen merely as fundraisers. Guidelines seek to prevent PTAs from being reduced to contributors or funds. their key role must be participation in decisions to improve teaching and learning outcomes. He explained the scope of PTAs in school development has now been tailored more towards involvement in learning and decision making processes. Mr. Sari also called on the Ghana education service to ensure the effective implementation of the guidelines and that was coming from the ministry of education and the committee for PTA which is Mr. Assari and Hara Idrisu and the Ministry of Education has officially rolled out PTAs across Ghana with new guidelines to strengthen the partnership between parents and teachers. And now the aim to make PTAs active in decision making about teaching and learning instead of focusing on only fundraising. Most of the times when you go to schools parents don't even have a say all they need to do is pay your PTA dues and they're gone. Now they've brought in new guidelines and the education minister Har Niguio stressed that education is a shared responsibility while the committee chair Kofi Asar noted that the new framework will help PTAs contribute more meaningfully to school development. So now back to you my ladies. Do you think PTA will, you know, allow our parents to really have a say when it comes to, you know, learning and teaching and learning rather than just being fundraisers? Messina. Okay. So, I would say for a very long time, parents have been fundraisers. They are um parents have been fundraisers. There are people who only contribute financially to the institution and to the welfare of their kids without involving themselves. And I think this is really bad. It got to a point I was questioning myself why is it so? Because in every school all the teachers are supposed to make sure that they include the um the parents and that is how it's supposed to be. I can't remember way back in JHS if your parent does not come for PTA you would be punished. You'll be punished and after being punished you pay for the fine. Exactly. And when this parent comes to the school they make sure whatever complaint that the teacher has. Why is everything okay at homework? What is happening? the teachers are doing their part and it's also up to the parents to also do their part. So when it comes to SHS and they are excluding the parents from the organization or from the welfare of the kids, I I think that it shouldn't be so. Mhm. So I'm very happy that they've implemented it again and it should come with um a more relevant solution. It shouldn't only be about money money because some some schools or some organizations in as much as they're including the parents they only including them for financial sake. That's how it was formally and it was very bad. Exactly. It shouldn't be like that. They should make sure that the parents also have a say because as you read most of the kids in fact all the kids spend a larger part of their lives in school. In school exactly so if they are not really including their the parents I think in a way it's bad so they should include them and make sure that they feel it and have impact. Yeah. Miss Evie, how do you think these new guidelines are going to be enforced in these schools rather than making parents fundraisers as Miss Regina said that if the school is facing a challenge or when they they embarking on a new project that is when they remember that oh the the the parents of these students are even there we can utilize them to raise fund. Should that be the case in the first place? No, it shouldn't be the case. But let me rectify this. Not all schools actually not all PTAs in some schools do that. I mean they wait till maybe um the school is lacking something and they need the what's the name they need the help of the parents and then they have to contribute them. No, the school I went PTA they don't only discuss about money money sometimes about the wealth of the student and I think sometime ago we were discussing this sometimes they discuss about your studies the PTA is about the studies of the student and then they they they bring your result me the school I went from DHS to senior high school your dad is sitting here then they hand the your report card to your dad Right. And my dad is not someone who I would say he's not educated. My dad he knows everything. So he's there and then they try to um help parents who are not too well educated in terms of the the grading and stuffs and then they tell your word that this is it. When your your word get this he or she is not performing and then they tell you. So some schools they don't only base on like money money money money but it's because I feel like 90% of some schools do that and for PCM they want to buy definitely you have to pay you have to pay some amount of money but now that they they are going to normalize it again I feel like it is good and then with the aspect of you saying the money but then it is more important when we focus more on wellbeing or the welfare of the student because the student assistance is your property as a parent. Whatever becomes of that child comes straight to you as a parent. Whether what comes out of that child is positive, you are going to benefit. Whether it comes out to be negative, it will still come back to hand to you. So when you go to PTM meetings, I feel like some schools should engage those schools that do not engage parents when it has to do with their study, they should start doing it. And so any fort if you know that like you didn't do well and sometimes the teachers will come and tell you in the face when your parents come and they will tell them the true fact. So they contribute to the wealth of the student. Sometimes they even tell the the the parents what you're supposed to get. Maybe oh she's not or he's not too good in studies. This is what is going to help. But if you still insist that you want him or her to study and be in school, then you have to get maybe a private teacher at home and then you lessen you lessen the activities of the child at home so you can focus on your books. So I feel like those schools who depend so much on money man money they should start I mean coming up and with the question you're asking me how we are going to do it I feel like we should get someone who monitor this PTA meetings who is coming directly from like the GES and then they come up like around monitoring their meetings see how it's It's good. You're supposed to contribute and then the child is supposed to be in a conducive environment. So he or she can study but aside that what's next? Because conducive environment at the end of the answer. So in as much as we want a conducive environment, you should also think about the child as well the the the improvement when it has to do with studies. So those schools they should start backing up until we when we want them to back up the best thing we can do is monitor them. Monitor them. Yes. Monitor them. I remember when I was in school whenever they call for PTA meetings my heart. That's the time our parent\r\n",

         "Should Christians take part in politics—or stay away from it? 🤔\nIn this episode of the iTiS Thursday Weekly Katchup (John 4:24), we dive into one of the most debated topics: The Role of a Christian in National Politics.\nThrough Scripture and real-world reflections, we explore:\n💭 Jeremiah 29:7 → Should Christians actively seek the peace and prosperity of their nation?\n💭 Acts 1:15–26 → If Spirit-filled believers once cast lots, should Christians today participate in voting?\n💭 1 Peter 4:10 → Are our gifts only for the Church—or also for serving our nation?\n💭 Matthew 5:13–16; Colossians 4:6 → What does it mean to be the “salt and light” in politics?\n💭 Matthew 28:18–20; Romans 13:1–7 → If both the Church and the State belong to God, how should they work together?\n💭 From Joseph, Daniel, Esther, Nehemiah, and Cornelius → Were they just believers, or also political leaders?\n👉 This discussion challenges us to rethink faith, governance, and the believer’s responsibility in shaping society.\n🗓 Recorded live during the iTiS Thursday Weekly Katchup.\n🔔 Don’t forget to like, share, and subscribe for more engaging conversations from the iTiS Well of Worship Fellowship.\n#ChristianPolitics #FaithAndSociety #BibleStudy #iTiSKatchup #KingdomInfluence",

For those of you who are in East Africa, this is in truth and in spirit world of worship fellowship. It is a Thursday and every Thursday we have a weekly catch up where we have sometimes a Q&R questions and responses and other days we have uh uh topical discussions and today since it is a Thursday uh we are going to discuss the role of a Christian in in national politics our role. So we'll be um investigating whether Christians have something to do in about national politics, whether they should participate in where they shouldn't. Uganda is u is heading to to the elections of 2026. Uh the candidates were picking their nominations and so far I think uh three of them or four of them have been approved. That's president [Music] of common man's party is Robert of National Platform has picked his paper. Then uh General Mugishamu has also picked his party from the anti- alliance of national transformation. I think that's the party. And then there is also another new in front and mir the old one also has also picked his papers I guess. Uh they there are eight in number for Uganda I think now others I think have not been approved. So Uganda is heading into an election. So our topic this uh this week is is asking our our role as Christians. Should we participate? Shouldn't we? Among those that have picked their papers, President Musevani is seemingly an Anglican who is not a regular Anglican. The head of late is here. He will tell us the quality of the membership of President Mus in the Anglican church whether he's a regular member or an absentee member. You will tell us Zen Robert is a Catholic who also known regular in the Catholic church. I don't know his denomination and so is Miri and Mua is a Muslim and is a regular and in good standing as as as a Muslim because he he observes all the brilliant. So, so we are we asking uh this Thursday the following questions. Should Christians seek peace and the flourishing of their society later on their country through whatever necessary and applicable means? What we mean here is uh historically President Musevan went to the to the bush and fought a sitting government and overthrew it. An elected government and overthrew it. And he was celebrated by all the cultural institutions and the religious institutions by that act. And when we asked those religious institutions why they celebrated that rebel who overthrew a legit government, a government that was elected by the people, they gave two reasons. First, the elected government had become evil against its people. Number two, u they said that it was justifiable to fight evil. So in other words, should Christians physically and with ammunitions fight evil, an evil government and overthrow it or unseat it? Is it the right? Is it the Christian thing to do? I have a verse for that. That's Jeremiah 29:7. You guys today, I'm not going to read those verses. You read those verses and then they'll help you. So should Christians seek peace and uh and the flourishing of their society? By all means necessary. In other words, for the purposes of this context and this discussion. If the leader is is corrupt, should we stand against that leader as a Christian to make sure that we solve the problem of corruption? Yes or no? Why? Number two, we'll be asking now that a group of believers filled with the Holy Spirit cast lots, should the Christians participate in voting? And you guys, I know a number of you who do not want to vote. One of them, I am not shy to mention him. This one is my brother. Jethro doesn't want to vote. I don't remember the last time he cast a vote. And there are many who look like him. Okay. So, should Christians participate in voting? All right. And there is a scripture for that. Acts 1 verse 15- 16 verse 15- 26 where the disciples had to cast votes or a lot to determine who was going to replace Judah the betrayer. Okay. Number three, we'll be asking, are believers only gifted to serve in church and not for their country? Because according to the Bible, there are those who are gifted with interpreting languages, those who have gifts of healing, apostles. Some are apostles, others are prophets, others are preachers, others are pastors, others, you know, you know those those those gifts of the Holy Spirit. So does the Holy Spirit gift us to only work in the church local and not even work in our and work for our country? Our gifts for church are not for country. Okay. So we'll be we'll be addressing that also as well. And I have a verse for that. 1 Peter verse 4:10. You guys ready for that? We are late. That's why I'm rushing. Number four will be also asking how are Christians the salt and the light of the of politics. Can we be the salt and light of politics? Now that we castigate politics is a dirty game de because you Christians have not sanitized it. You who are not dirty. So shouldn't you who are clean involve yourself into a dirty business and cleanse it from its dirt and flavor it now that pastors because recently there was a bishop in in northern Uganda who who rebuked President Musev someone should look for that audio by the way Jethro you should look for that that audio I think is in audio or video something he was from northern Uganda he rebuked president and told him I'm going to tell Tell you what others do not want or fear to tell you. Number one, you are wrong to overstay in power. Number two, those who are telling you that your government is safe. They are lying to you. All governments have fallen apart. You need to start working for your people and helping them. You have abused Ugandans. Someone should look for that bishop and share that uh that thing with us. Jethro and Andrew Tana, please look for that bishop. Now, so was that bishop being the salt of uh of politics and the light to the darkness in politics or not? Should is that how Christians should participate in in politics? I have a verse for that. Matthew 5:3-16. And then does both okay. Okay. Doesn't both the church which is here to preach the gospel and nature faith and the state which is here to maintain order punish evil and promote justice doesn't both belong to God and shouldn't they work hand in hand okay because in uh in the stud of politics there's the doctrine of the church and the state where some politicians argue that these must be distinct members and they serve different purposes at a certain point President backlash at religious leaders told them, \"You do your work and let me do my work. Leave politics for me. Concentrate on preaching the gospel.\" Was the president right in that? Okay. The regious council is always trying to engage the politicians to see how the religious council in Uganda at least to see how services can reach the the populace. Shouldn't the state and the church work together or hand in hand or these are just distinct entities that cannot cooperate for the betterment of of of the country. All right, I have a verse for that. Romans chapter 13 verse 17 and Matthew chapter 28 to 20. Finally. Amen. Where people like uh the centurion in Matthew 85:13, Cornelius in Acts 10, Nehemiah in Nehemiah 1 and 2, Esther the queen of Persia in Esther 4:4, Joseph in Genesis 41, and Daniel in the book of Daniel. where these people just Christians or more of politicians. This is what we'll be discussing today. You're welcome. This is in truth and in spirit well of worship fellowship. It is a non-denominational fellowship. We engage thoughts here. We provoke your thinking. We discuss all matters. For us, we think that politics is our business as Christians at it. That's why we discuss politics. But we make sure that we flavor our discussions of politics with the will and the word of God to make sure that we don't run into unnecessary battles. May God bless you as you participate into this in Jesus name. Amen. Okay. Who wants to go? Who wants who wants to go first? The man your mic is on. Is that intentional or? Hey. Yes. Uh I was driving I was driving so I just left it on so that I don't have to keep that. That's all right. Then you want to go first sir anywhere? Yeah. Uh uh from from how you've introduced it I'm going first of all say that Christians are not any different from uh other human beings. We we are the same. And uh if politics is to affect it affects us in the same way how it affects other people who are not Christian. So uh if it calls for participation we're supposed to part or we are obliged to participate like any other human being. We are not any special any special breed. Uh that will be my first point. Now the second one I'll bring the the aspect of Uganda uh the the point of religion and politics and I'll bring it in the historical perspect the the context of history uh how does religion and politics come in here now before before the politics and the religion that we have here we already had religion and politics that was at play just that uh that now it is a bit different when the white men when the white men came here in the 19th century. Uh if you recall very well the explorers came then in 19 in 1975 uh that this Henry Martin Stanley wrote a letter where they said that Kabaka wrote requesting for for Christians to come and they eventually came after two years in 1877. the church missionary society Christians came and then the Roman Catholic also came and then and eventually the religion entered what entered Uganda and it spread across across the the whole of Uganda. Now when the region came the politics also came because after after the region had come the missionaries laid the foundation for the for colonization. So the missionaries came in 1877. They they put up uh they first of all they indoctrinated uh they inoculated the natives they found here uh by convincing them that whatever they woriing was devilish was black was bad and they introduced a better god who was white uh a better worship system and uh in doing that they also weakened the traditional leadership because before they came here we already had politics Yeah. And this politics was mainly monarchies which was Uganda which was in Koreo to those were the the strong ones. Then we also had the chiefts as you all know. Now when they came they first of all weakened our traditional systems, the religion and then eventually they weakened the the political system where they ended up arresting the the most powerful kings that was cover and at the peak of it all remember even before arresting them was it before after the religious wars after arresting them and taking them into exile now they remove that that politic of monarchism and now there's a virtue. So in in 187 in 1894 Uganda is declared the protectorate. Now it's being taken over by the British who ruled up to 1962. Now why I'm bringing all this history is that uh the British brought their politics here the democracy that you can choose a leader. Yet for us Africans we didn't have that. Okay. We we we we knew that leadership was was was you could become a leader by birth. Like if if your father fought and uh took over the the amount of from from uh his brothers then that means that leadership is going to be flowing through the blood but not through the bar the bar the bar. So these guys came rolled us for probably let's say 70 years then when they leaving they said now leadership is going to go through what it's going to be going through the the the box which was which actually is not which is actually not and I'm just referring to the case of because we can say that we have had three presidents the first president came in the one that the British left here of course with the games they played They had to make sure that a Catholic which also brings in that aspect of religion a Catholic who had who had been voted into power they had to play their tricks and kick him out. I'm talking about then they brought in an Anger they left here but that Angan leader was removed from power then eventually then he was also removed again then seven comes in now now this guy who comes in seven now goes back to the tradition the mindset of an African that when I get power remember power is like what we have said in in this Ugandan context It's so you can say that somehow came through the bar but of course the bar of 1961 the the Catholics will not agree and the DP will not agree that actually it was legit. So you have who comes and becomes a true leader like how his ancestors were. You come into leadership, you rule. After ruling and after you died, you leave it your son. And uh but try trying to consolidate what the white man what the westerners shattered. Ahu. Yes. Try to cons but on this side the westerners are telling you that you have to be voting every 5 years. And the man is like okay it's okay. Let's keep voting. But the reality is that if you not being coerced that voting will not be there and we are talking about Uganda, you go to Rwanda, go to southern Sudan, go to the other time Sudan of Bash, go to I think most most countries in Africa are like that. leadership is is leadership is uh okay politics in Africa we are still our mindset is still in that thing of of how the monarchies operate so and which is not which is and I want you to emphasize that it is not right to demonize our monarchical order of leadership and praise the the western democracy I don't think that theirs theirs was better than us. It could have been better for them and ours was actually actually better for us. Yes. And you see uh when you look at at at Britain which coronized us, they have a leader who has the one who has absolute powers is is the monarchy. Yes. Then they have this prime minister they keep changing and that prime minister probably has I don't know about the administrative if Francis was here was going to tell us how powerful the prime minister is but the real power is held in that family and and they don't vote for that family. Now when you ask should a Christian be involved me I'll go back and say that uh because our system was disorganized and now we are we are using the system that is not real. So how how can a Christian be involved in this uh in quotes the so-called democracy which is actually not really democracy but we have to participate. I would say that a Christian should take a lukewarm position because I literally even if you participate there's nothing much you're going to change you started by telling us that Christians are not special they as affected as non-Christians with by politics. So why shouldn't a Christian in what actually affects them? Now because you see when you participate the participation of the Christian is the 1981 February 6th of getting a gun and you go and fight a regime. So if you want to participate as a Christian then you can do that here in Uganda or you go on the streets they shoot they shoot and probably you do what Sudan did the Sudan did that is the participation but as I let you go in again in your submission I was following you closely you said that somehow somewhere president has managed to smuggle monarchism into the western democracy and that's why in power can't we Christian values into this sin darkened politics and then we flavor it with what is right at the same time I mean at that level participation not fighting physically not having all those ammunitions not having these strikes on the streets but at least participating in a very logical and sensible way to try to sanize this politics now My my my okay my argument is uh you see the the the the difference between uh I I I'll I'll borrow UK where I've been talking about the power is in uh it's in the monarchy then I'll also look at an example of Kenya and Tanzania where the leaders and Arab Moy decided to give people power. Okay. Now, it was the intention of the leader to give people power. And that is why in in Kenya and in in Tanzania, we see something that is that is a bit there's some democracy because the president does not have absolute powers. their leader their leaders and and gave away that power. Now if all the leader that comes after him does not do that then we are lying to ourselves that we can change anything with with this participation in the political exercise. until that until that thing that time happens and we have a leader who has agreed to give power to the people then there we have the power to choose but until that and and if that thing hadn't happened in Kenya up to now if Moya decided to to rule them the way you wanted to rule would not be having this change of leadership like it's happening or if decided not to to to give away power it would also still like Uganda. Okay. Really? Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Uh our resident psychologist Dave on the mic. Can you say hello? Hey Dave, is that you? All right. Uh still switching on his mic. Arion, are you well? Are you driving or you? No. No. I am well. I'm well. I'm well. I'm well. I'm well and listening in. That's all right. Uhhuh. Jessica, Jessica, you're welcome. It's good to have you here, my sister. Keep following. All right. Uh uh. Ah, I have lost I have lost Jet. I've lost Jet now. Okay. Uh any any person who wants to come in at this point? Noisy background with Dave. You cannot. Okay. I hope you can hear us with that noisy background still. If you can hear us, that's all right. you keep texting us so that we can follow your your thoughts. So, so Arong, do you think as a Christian you should participate in uh in politics or it is a dirty a dirty game to for us Christians to avoid. I personally think that uh in order for me to be a Christian, I must be in this world. Yes. where there is that all over. So, so saying a Christian should not participate in politics is is being doile and lazy because politics has has has has has very many faces. In in in friendship there is politics. In marriage there is politics. there is this other mainstream politics of ruling a country nations. So, so, so, so before we can say Christians should not participate in the politics or they should participate in politics, we need to appreciate the fact that Christians are well and aware that they are in this world where politics matters, where political beliefs matter. After all, even Jesus is a politician. He's in politics. He's a little different from ours, but he is. Thank you. Brilliant. Brilliant. That's that's that's very helpful. Uh you have actually reminded us that uh a human being is a political animal. uh uh majority of uh their sociology is is is politics. Marriage is about is playing politics. Uh family is a political arena. Uh work work spaces there's the politics of the workspace. There's the politics on the street. Okay. I think that's very interesting. And then the other thing also to emphasize is that uh if if if you don't want to involve yourself into political affairs, politics will involve itself into your personal affairs. So it is better that you the best way in football we say that the best way to defend is to attack. We argue that it is a little bit better to to involve yourself into politics before politics involves itself into the affairs of your life. That that's brilliant. Governor 17, are you there? Can you talk or you are far away? Can you say hello? Yes, I can say hello. And I don't know how is the noise. Okay, that you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. In case you want to say something, you you come up and say something. I just wanted to congratulate you that in these campaigns we have a Muslim candidate Mubarak. So Islam is one of the political figures that we have in this country. But is Uganda a religious country? No, Uganda is not a religious country. But we are trying to demonstrate how religion can participate in politics. So when we get these religious people participating in politics, we celebrate them. For instance, for instance, President is an Anglican. I don't know whether he's in good standing with the Anglican. Oh, okay. So but the head of here you can tell us whether president is still in the register. I have been told that who is in in the Anglican church she was made a canon recently yes so we have Canon who is the minister of energy. So I think religious people should participate in politics by all means and I think having a canon in the ministry of energy has actually boosted our ministry of energy and is performing because we have what are you what are you laughing about and Isaiah yes that guy the seventh day who was the president of was it was it Marawi or I think Marawi Zambia Zambia Zambia Yeah. Did he lose? Hasn't he lost? I don't know whether he lost the second term. I have not checked yet. Cuz they voted. I think they voting. The one from the one from the one who lost and the other one got 57%. Yeah, I think he lost. But I'm told he was very corrupt with his SDA church with his religious beliefs. then. So basically what you saying Christians are not the light to politics because they look like the politics or yo you are trying to say that uh because uh Robert had a complaint that religious leaders have not helped the struggle because uh the sitting government bribes them with cars and what and they cannot speak their mind and some of them actually have demonstrated that the religious council has also been accused that is not doing their role because president has distributed cars among those religious leaders and the most influential ones. So they are not doing their role of being the sort of politics and the light of the dark politics is and then you came up with that example of that corrupt religious leader of of Zambia. I don't know whether you talk about the Zambian 7th Adventist or the Malawian born again because the for Malawi it was it was a born again. Yes. I'm going I'm going to Google I'm going to Google it's called if that is that is Zambia. I think that is Zambia. Good. Brilliant. So yes. So uh people here can't talk unfortunately. So we are we are trying to ask ourselves we are openminded. Let them we shall not judge them. We are trying to to to ask ourselves how we can better participate in uh as Christians and by we I mean Christians. How can Christians participate in uh in uh in this in this whole thing? Now uh now that I would like to ask you was prophet Muhammad just religious leader or also a political leader and a revolutionary is a leader and a leader means politics. Oh yeah. Because when you look at when you look at the history of Islam etc. you you don't only see God but you also see the politics at play. and how you organize those Arab countries. And actually if in my opinion if one wants to separate politics and this political groups or religions I think that person is is is missing something because it's uh it's it's politics that has has ruled everything everything in the history of uh human beings. things. But I'm told that uh before before Constantine uh religion and politics were separate. You you had the kings then you also had the the religious people. It is it is this Constantine that comes and and uses them. But but you see but you see I mean when when you go back to that history that where you want to go you will have the struggle to separate monarchism with theocracy. I think monarchism was just a hand of the theocracy. Kings were we are ruling on behalf of the gods. So there was no point when there was no point in history when the church and the state were separate entities. It is these westerners who actually came up with that whole idea that the the church and state should be should be separated. But even when you go back to our indigenous religions, a religion at at its primitive stage, you will see that the pharaohs were representatives of the gods. The kings in Israel, for those of you who are Bible readers, we are representative of the gods. Muhammad is killing and in and in all his jihad wars organizing those Arab nations he's killing in the name of Allah and he's saving and say redeeming others believers in the name of Allah that's why I asked whether you can separate Muhammad from politics can you separate David the most popular king of the Bible from politics and religion at the same time then when you come back here uh let me talk on behalf of the Waganda who are not here today. At least the dev who is here cannot speak but uh the the Kabaka Mui is is the representative of the gods of Buganda and that is that was our leadership. So you can see that significantly the church and the state are one and the same thing here. They wanted the same thing. But but recently we had uh we we had Exactly. So So our our setting of of monarchism was was almost a hand or a branch of of a theocracy. You see? So, so, so for me, for me, I really think that whole idea of you can separate church and state, I don't it is just it is also another politics to to make sure that the values that the religious leaders are going to to to share won't gag the corruption and the deception and the deceit of politics that want to be exercised. For me, I think that's that's that's the whole idea. And when you go to the United States, Trump was voted in religiously. The conservatives are the religious again the most religious. So you can see that the church had had a contribution largely to the success of uh of Trump. Back here in Uganda, we had a war between uh my elder brother, General Moes Kerugaba and and Shik Chitti. I don't know whether you guys have been following Shik Chitti. She shik Chitti is is a Muslim cleric and he keeps uh he he keeps showing his side. He he's a supporter toi and because the the politics in Uganda has been abused to the level of offense and defense to show that you you you hate muse you have to offend him which I disagree with and to show that you love you have to offend the city government. So he's been doing that thing like that. Then recently uh general as usual and I and I like what he's doing by the way uh he communicated through ex through his exhandle okay and said she if you don't stop that nonsense I will come for you and you will tell me if you don't stop attacking the king of Uganda and by the king of Uganda yes and by the king of Uganda I guess he meant Uh my father, my one and only father, President Musef and she in his next presentation started saying He was actually Yes. So the guy chickened out and did what? But [Laughter] was doing it in the wrong way. Okay. But again, how how how better would would have participated in the politics? Because why why do you have to why do you have to threaten Shei? Why? And why don't you appreciate the correction from Shikh Chitti? Then to Shikh Chitti, I ask why do you have to attack and insult meaning that any time the president might die? Why why do you have to use that angle of insult and not use a a professional way and a better way? I mean, why don't you be the the light? Why why don't you shed light on the darkness of politics instead of shedding darkness on the darkness of politics by insults? I think I think as as as religious people that's what we we need to do. Any good uh any person who wants to to share with us? Yes. Is there? Yes. Uh I want to I want to come back to to to where I stopped. uh in in in in the 1970s we we had D bishop who was eventually killed in 1977 and uh they say that he was you used to criticize the the government of but on the same hand there's also another cardinal for the for the for the Roman Catholic church who was called Emanuel And uh for him he was not he was not murdered. But uh in they say from what history or from from the Israel read he was also equally very very very he used to criticize a means government but for him his criticism was stopping on what on the pullpit and I think he had he had he was using the pullpit effectively by by criticizing what Amin was doing the same thing that uh that uh that uh this guy was also doing uh room. But uh the the what happened is that uh uh okay maybe this is to drag you to some history but but people say that the state research bureau did some intelligence and indeed there are some reverence that were shipping guns from Tanzania and that is why R was killed. R was not killed because he was criticizing with his mouth. room was killed because for him he had taken the the war physically by by engaging what by engaging arms. Now that's why I said if if you're a Christian and you want to engage uh for example this because this is a military you know that is one thing that we fail to understand this is a government that is being led by rebels. There's a time when talking about you look at a guy like he started fighting when you were 16. He started and when you talk about fighting we're talking about killing people. He started seeing death. In fact even his nickname they say that he was called Rufu. He started seeing death when he was 16 years. Okay. So you can imagine his entire life he he he doesn't he has no life that there's one that died I think two years ago with one eye there are so many generals that are living where they say they have then also even the president himself is a former rebel leader now I want you to understand the people that are leading us and then you tell them that a bar can take them away for you shouting as a as a river that you go or like you just go and start saying those things and think that such things can move a man who started seeing death at 16 years. So that's why if you involve yourself as a Christian, you have to involve yourself as if you have a get guns and try to fight against this government because this government the only language they can hear is the language the sound of a gun. Period. Yes. But but you see with or without the gun I think we can as Christians we can still participate in uh in politics. Uh we might leave the guns for them since they are gunmen and then also negotiate our our role also because we still have a role to play. Uh it's not the gun negotiating. It's not negotiating. Yeah I know. Yeah I know. Yes, you can negotiate Rufu. You can you can negotiate Ruf because now Rufu sits in Rufus sits in Capeek and sits in northern Uganda. Then Rufu calls calls the parliament to where he is. Uh but you can negotiate Rufu about the health care if you are the minister of health and tell him we need this and these drugs. You can negotiate with Rufu about good roads. You can negotiate with Rufu about education system. You know, as long as Rufu is in charge, you can negotiate these other things. But I think we Christians also have been lazy. We have not participated because look at uh you are the historian here. Look at Idiamin and the other guy whom we the Jenn Yes. You can see that the jans were were making some noise really. They were making some noise but the silence and the indifference by the modern religious leaders is also scary in one way or another. I think we can do better than what we we are doing. So this whole thing of these are these formers etc etc. Yes, they are granted. But uh does can evil stop us from out of our houses? I don't think so. We should get actually what what we should stop is from religion you know uh to involve ourselves in in in in the politics because take an example of Congo and when you take when you take an example of Congo, Congo is full of uh I think Christians uh that are you know ruling the the government. I mean they decide who comes in and uh it has been all priests, it's been chefs been religious leaders who have you know luggages that are not allowed you know by the governments and and so forth. I think it's uh it's religious leaders who have put themselves into this and there's no way they can you know you can say no I'm a religious leader I'm just helping some people to overthrow the government I would kill more if I was part of the government I would everything and and I th...",

Many return home injured, traumatized, or in some cases never make it back. Two Kenyans are reported to have recently returned with one currently admitted to Kenyata National Hospital. The construction of the regional maritime and shipping logistics training center at the cost of 1 billion shillings in the remote village of W in Quali County is almost complete. Education CS Jula made the announcement during World Maritime Day celebrations at the Kenya Maritime Authority headquarters in Mombasa. Kenya government with the support from the World Bank under the East Africa skills for transformation and regional integration project has been developing a model training school for maritime transport and port logistics at W in Qual County. This premier facility operating as a compass of the Kenya Coast National Poly Technic is now 94% complete and will be ready to register trainees as early as January next year. The center is expected to admit over 1,500 students from Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Agamba also emphasized the need for stakeholders in the maritime sector to identify skill gaps and skills gaps and align training with industry demands. It is essential to engage with industry stakeholders, listening to their needs, understanding their skill gaps and aligning our curriculum with the realities of the sector. Together we can ensure that our graduates are job ready and equipped to contribute meaningfully to the maritime industry's growth and transformation. The government of Kenya through the Ministry of Education remains steadfast in his commitment to investing in education, skills development and infrastructure that will drive sustainable economic growth. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas has said he's ready to work with world leaders to implement a peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians announced by France on Monday. Speaking via video at the UN General Assembly, Abbas reiterated his rejection of a future governing role for Hamas in Gaza and demanded it disarm. He also called on countries which had not yet recognized a Palestinian state to do so and for the UN to grant it full membership. Abbas denounced Israel's military offensive in Gaza, accusing it of committing one of the most horrific humanitarian tragedies of the 20th and 21st centuries. But he said he rejected the actions of Hamas in its acts in its attack on Israel on October 7th, 2023. That's the news. I'm Edwin Lisamira. 102.5 Spice FM Kisumu. The following takes place from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every weekday on Spice FM. In this country, six families and 8,000 kgans control 90% of the GDP. We are not a country. We are a plantation. We work for R. When you're telling the judges court orders are papers or they will not obey court orders, they're sitting and you're seeking orders from them. So, how are they supposed to interpret it? Isn't it an oxymoron? When you see a judiciary that seems to be under some control somewhere, you start questioning. We have very powerful governors, but they don't use their offices to serve the people. If you are not shameful to do what you are doing, why should we protect you? I'm human. Everybody's human. So when you're told I mean you'd be a fool to conversations have to be had. You know people in leadership should only go into leadership if they are ready and willing to change the lot of the people. The situation board Kenya's biggest conversation. If we just gloss over issues and hope that time gals, then we may find that in generations to come we might be back at the same situation. And the whole thing is born of stolen elections. When it comes to the decisions you make, you must be independent. There's no way you can allow one institution to dictate to you how you're going to conduct your operations, how you're going to decide cases. It's a no. When you weaken the institution to the point where they cannot take action, then you realize that politicians have to come up and now start dealing with the issues. That conversation has to die. Our politicians do not like the hard stuff. We must insist on the path of doing things right whether popular or unpopular. Money changes hands. That is a fact. If you have political goodwill at the highest top like in Rwanda, then corruption will be an issue of the past. If you don't have political goodwill at the top, we will pass laws. We will amend laws. We will continue passing laws and be amending laws and nothing will happen. This is the situation rule. The only way to start your day. One of the things that are in our country is negative ethnicity. You find you as a state officer. Instead of thinking as a Kenyan, you think like a tribal person. Let me tell you something. The biggest problem we have had in this country is a leadership deficit. There is nothing that you are going to do in the process of change if you are not a risk taker. So you really have to pursue your vision to a logical conclusion and even be ready to step on people's toes. When it comes to the economy, you can run away with it. They say statistics are like bikinis. They reveal a lot, but they conceal the vitals. And so government people would would would throw statistics at you and tell you they're revealing a lot of information to you, but it's really concealing the real vitals. We need to get out of that because when we want to grow our democracy, one basic thing that really requires to be understood by the political class, by all of us, is institutions are critical. This is the situation room. The only way to start your day. Good morning and I love your show. Thank you. Thank you. Having come from a Kikuyu radio background, I migrated to Spice because of the content. I was born in Islam, but somehow I got a break in life. So sometimes when you see the sweating coming out because of the passion and whatever it is behind the noise, there are people and we share the same umbilical cord. It shouldn't be like that. I am so disappointed. We used to tell honorable that he's doing police of cornmanship and even president you cannot promise people that we reduce tax then you double in politics there is the issue of trust for you to turn around and then stab the same people who gave you that trust there is no other level of dishonesty the situation board Kenya's biggest conversation If we just gloss over issues and hope that time gals, then we may find that in generations to come, we might be back at the same situation. And the whole thing is born of stolen elections. When it comes to the decisions you make, you must be independent.

Mornings done right. 94.4 for Spice FM Nairobi. Good morning and uh good morning. Let me arrange myself in the chair before I fall down. Good morning. Good morning again. Good morning. Well done. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. I am alive and everything is shaping up. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I am assuming that it's a good thing. Yeah. Everything is okay. Yeah. Everything is okay. Nice. I think I overslept and then that's why I'm feeling tired. Is it possible to be tired from tired that you're tired is tired? Is it possible? Is that state of mind? I don't know. But like now if you can tell me indu come just come here. Lie down here. Close your eyes. Close the curtains. Just sleep. I cannot refuse. It's in your life. I cannot refuse. It's Friday. It's Friday. I know. And the weekend's here. So, we're getting into things. I'm glad to know that you're fine. Uh, so Friday and uh and Dennis with you. Uh, the other Dennis Okari is in Pakistan.

So, uh, with that, we'll have a couple of conversations today, and let me tell you what that will be in just a bit. When we say good morning to Eevee E, she's looking all floral with pink around her neck. And, uh, Jolene has been looking for coffee. Oh, look at that. She has even done the tan. I know Eve E. Shocking people every day. Uh, somebody please help Jolene and find coffee. Um, because she's not doing okay, guys. She's not okay. Mirani, Mr. Mirani. Mirani to the rescue. It's not okay. Uh today, I'm sorry, but the Kofia did not show up. Uh we were trying to see how we can make things work, but Christina has disappointed us gravely. Yeah. But uh she'll still try to make sure that you see the shows through the day. So those are the people who are doing things in the background. Rio came to the office today and then did not want to do his work. We are reporting him on national radio and TV and letting the world know that he has declined his duties. You know what would say? Yeah. So, good morning everybody and welcome. This is the situation room. It's Kenya's biggest conversation and Dennis here with you today as we get into things. There's som\r\n",

I am the founder and CEO of a stealth early stage addiction care company. Um my primary area of research is the intersection between the gut brain axis and addiction across various substances including um foods, drugs and behavioral addictions. I was formerly the vice president and general manager of a precision fermentation company in the alt protein space and prior to that I was the chief operating officer of a fiber technology company focused on prebiotic fibers for gut health. My background is in chemical and biological engineering as well as business. And then Ivan, I'll pass it to you. Thanks. Um so my name is Ivan Kla. um half German, half Taiwanese, but actually coming to you from Portugal today. So, uh bit of an international background there. Been working in health for 20 years now. Um and currently I'm a health manager helping people to essentially manage their health and be well um through lifestyle medicine. And then I'd hand it back to you, Matt. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Yeah. So, we've got a great group of people here and I think you know the the way I'd like to start this first probably and unfortunately for you Ivon but we're here in the US and like Maha is just all over the place right and I think that's probably a good um place to to start. So, a couple of weeks ago, um you know, there was this news about, hey, we're going to get rid of these food dyes, you know, um all of these artificial synthetic food dyes because that's the thing that's causing the downfall for all of us, right? Um and then, uh some other stuff happened as usually does. And and just a couple of days ago, then we had this other thing, not directly food related, but it was like, no, no, Tylenol is bad for a pregnant woman. Don't take this at all, right? because it might lead to autism and things like that. So, um I'm not picking on any of those in particular, but the for first sort of like general topic here is like how much science and education is necessary to help us understand these topics today. Uh and maybe you know, Ivon, you can kind of start us off there since you're trying to help people figure figure this out. That's a good question, Matt. And uh um as a trained scientist both natural scientist and social scientist I would always uh root for science and say you absolutely need to have a scientific base. Um on which to make decisions. Um that doesn't necessarily mean that every individual has to understand every single scientific paper that's out there. Obviously that's uh not the not the kind of benchmark that we're setting. Um but in my personal opinion in terms of recommendations either for individuals or for the public so personal health or public health if it's not rooted in scientific evidence then quite frankly what are we doing like um that's just uh playing with people's lives really um because at the end of the day health uh impacts lives and to not use the methodologies that we have and the evidence that we collectively um as a scientific community have created is Yeah. It's just not very responsible in my opinion. No, I I hear that. But I I feel like and and I'm pulling this cuz like it's just come across my feed in recent days, right? Where people um what's the word? Uh how can I say this diplomatically? like oh that's your opinion or interpretation of certain things right um and one thing that you know as all of us are are scientists here are thinking and probably when we're reading things like I know there's this bit of fear about being wrong and wrong being that hey in science as you get more data right what you're going to think and and and recommend next sort of changes right and it kind of needs to update and evolve um and I know, like in most parts of our everyday lives, we're all very comfortable with that fact. But when it comes to something like experts out there telling us what we should eat or do or or all of those sort of things, there seems to be less tolerance for that, hey, it needs to be updated kind of thing, right? Um, and that's sort of leading into our topics of, you know, behavior change around all of this. But I kind of want to throw that out there to anybody to to kind of comment on that. But like why why does it feel like, you know, there's there's less wiggle room for scientists to say these things? Uh even though we know like basically that's how the world works, right? More data, things need to be updated. Yeah, I I wouldn't mind um jumping in. Um, you know, I I think some of this can be traced to a romanticizing of nature, you know, and and this interest in like natural claims, you know, on a lot of the products that I'm reviewing for clients. um you know for since since I started about 20 years ago um those natural that natural messaging is so appealing to consumers and over time that's evolved into this like clean label concept um you know which food companies sort of contort themselves to to fit in sometimes you know um and and at the It's sort of got gotten more and more extreme where, you know, now we're to the point where if a consumer um finds it difficult to pronounce a word like phospholipid, that is now equivalent to there being um a basis for having safety concerns about a substance. And I I find that level of um sort of mistrust of science or like a fear of chemistry or some you know chemophobia um I you know is something that's I think very real in California in particular and um that that's all very unfortunate because people are I think putting a lot of um they're having a lot of stress about issues that aren't like real at the end of the day. you know, I have two kids, um, a 15-year-old and a 13-year-old, and, uh, the 13-year-old, you know, has come home from school telling me that, uh, because she had like M&M's or something, uh, at Halloween, you know, that that kids are saying like, \"Oh, that has red 40 in it and you're going to get cancer, you So, so these are messages that are very um prevalent and that affect, you know, even really young children, like it's not just grown-ups. And um I think that's uh concerning because red 40, for example, is not associated with with cancer risk. Mhm. You said the word phospholipid, which means you have my complete attention since one of my fats and lipids and emotions. But I agree with you in that I think we're facing this time in our culture where there's so much more data available than ever before. There's so much faster information and communication going back and forth to so many more people than ever before. You know, previously you had to wait for your publication, you know, your professional organization to put out, you know, articles that had been peer- reviewviewed. So if a new ingredient was developed, you might not like hear about it until a lot of work had been done on it and decisions had already been made. And so I think there was more inherent like need to trust the people who did have the information because not everybody did. And now we're moving to a model where this information is and and like wishes, hopes, fears, dreams are getting spread so quickly uh that we are losing the usual ways the previous ways we had authority and trust in authority. So what do we have now? Like do we have any trust in people who spend their whole days and their whole like years and decades and careers like up to their eyeballs our eyeballs in this you know this one field are does that make us more trustworthy like as a scientist? I hope it does. Um, but you know what is what is authenticity and what is trust now in this age of like an incredible amount of data and the speed of communication being so high and and the horse isn't going back in the barn like we live here now. Yeah. I'm going to I don't disagree with the several of the points that have been brought up, but I'm going to try to steal man a little bit of the Maha argument. Um, and I largely view maja as a really bad answer to a really good question. And that really good question is there is something wrong here. People have lost trust in the experts because the experts or many of them have gotten something egregiously wrong when it comes to our food system. Over the last 50 years, chronic diseases have exploded. diabetes has exploded, obesity, Alzheimer's, addictions. Um, it's not gaslighting to say that, you know, I'm from the South, right? And so I've witnessed a lot of this firsthand. And so, you know, to say that there is something wrong is not fundamentally incorrect. The very unfortunate thing, though, is I think that sentiment is largely getting hijacked for people's own, you know, commercial or pet interests, right? You see it with maybe red 40. You know, there are studies about it being problematic, but getting rid of red 40 is not going to fix all these chronic diseases. You certainly see it with people railing against the modern food system and then saying buy my supplement, right? Probably not the right um place in the right time. So I I do think that ultimately scientific inquiry on bioscientific inquiry will help us really understand some of these root causes but I don't know that it is appropriate to say that um everything was good 20 years ago and it's this you know um proliferation of misinformation that is suddenly confusing people and leading down a wrong path. There is something wrong here. Mhm. No, I like what you said there too because as you were talking about that, I was thinking about uh how everybody now is fascinated with measuring stuff, right? we have like 10 different wearables we can have and we're measuring all of this stuff and then like you and and Megan were saying well which of this data is relevant and what what what part of those things that we're measuring is actually correlated to or maybe going to help us understand better the things that we need to do right um maybe this is a Avon sort of question right as you\r\n",

         "Расшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:September we going towards October people have gone without salaries especially the county staff madam speaker counties are borrowed you know once you borrow from banks once you pay you pay with a lot of interest I think as a house madam speaker we need to have a a conversation around this arrangement because madam speaker that spiritual involution is being diluted every every other Okay, because madam speaker we need to have an expressing dispensation on the timely dispersement of funds to counties. Actually speak I think we that is the reason why most of the governors would even want to claim that uh that is a genesis of quite a number of pending bills that we are witnessing because you know by virtue of having no funds in doesn't stop the services yeah we have those recurrent expenses are being incred almost every day we have vehicles getting failed we have so many other miscellaneous accretes that are taking place and I'm very uh some of these activities are current under the arrangement of we are going to get money. So I think honorable speaker we madam speaker we must get very clear arrangements on how we are supposed to make this disarmment effective. I don't know for what reasons I think I could in one of my good friends talk of a to Morocco where we have efficient very timely dispersement of funds to relevant counties where you don't have even to engage the national government. I don't know what's the role what is the role of government in the whole exercise. No, we have those very independent institutions which are supposed now to make sure that counties get their money timely so they can run uh the services are intended to be run and we expect maybe honor madam speaker once these funds are dispersed to counties we expect that the governors to be intelligent enough we make sure that money is put into proper use so that that the very essence of pollution is being realized. So madam speaker I strongly support that uh we pass this uh schedule so that maybe our counties can enjoy. But of course madam speaker I I it's very sad for me for the last almost four 3 months now people are going without salaries people are servicing their rooms some servicing their school fees and it's very pathetic madam speaker that we have to experience this kind of situation year out year in I support you madame speaker uh senator Um, Madame Speaker, uh, from the word go, I want to declare that I support this the report on the standing committee on finance and budget. Madame speaker, counties are distinct governments. It is unfortunate that throughout uh the period of financial year we are here always lamenting about disbbursements and madame speaker to me it is like the counties are on the receiving end when it comes to disbbursement and yet the law is very clear madame speaker that there's a timeline that is stated by The 15th of each month, county governments which are distinct governments as enshrined in the law, the constitution of this country must receive their funds. Madame speaker, the reason that is always given is that these funds are not available. But something else that comes out very uh badly, Madame Speaker, is that at the end of the financial uh year, the county governments are given funds at a go and yet there's hardly time to spend these funds. Then somebody erroneously makes comments that county governments are supposed to be ready to use these funds. Madame speaker, even the procurement plans that the counties have are drawn with the knowledge that funds will be dis dispersed at their rightful times. Madame Speaker, having said that county governments are distinct, it is important to note that we need timely dispersement and not only timely but as the as the report says the disbment of these funds must be stable and be predictable. Madame Speaker, predictability ensures that these funds are planned for and some wise people say said and I believe them and I know I'm one of them that when you plan when you fail to plan then you're planning to fail. Madam Speaker, the counties have various services that must be offered to our people at the counties. Key amongst them is the services of health. Just this afternoon, I've uh been here as uh these outstanding members of the Senate discuss the issue of Kenyata National Hostel and it is because health is key to all of us. Madame Speaker, for the counties to provide the services that are devolved to them like health which is a basic to our people. It means funds must be dispersed to them in time. We do not want a situation where when a schedule is already drawn out and approved, Madame Speaker, then we are treated to cases of counties lining up at the controller of budget office or at treasury. Madame speaker, we have met the controller of budget several times as a senate. I remember the last time the controller budget was appear uh was making a presentation while we were at NASA in a retreat and the controller budget continuously denied the fact that county officers always line up in her office in the process of uh approvals for disbbursement. Madame Speaker, this is a truth that there's a lot of paperwork that has to be done and yet what baffles me, Madame Speaker, is that the controller of budgets office also has devolved officers at the counties. So one wonders why what kind of work this devolved officer of the controller of budget referred to as the county office of the controller of budget does with the county government throughout the month because all they should be looking at is to ensure that the documentation is done at the county and officers do not need to spend all the time at the controller. of budgets off uh at the office of the controller of budget uh going back and forth to the counties in the name of going back to get certain documentation and this is a reality. Uh, Madame Speaker, Madame Speaker, what I'm saying is that the countries must have a seamless process of getting funds that are due to them having been approved by the parliament. Madame Speaker, there are several uh services that we are expecting the counties to offer in time, efficiently, and effectively. I've mentioned health. Madam Speaker, we need to get our people need to get drugs in hosts. Madame Speaker, it pains me when I'm in the village and you have women carrying uh sick children or even women sick and even men, Madame Speaker, when they are sick and they go to hosts and then they miss drugs in the names that funds have not been dispersed to counties. Madam Speaker, it is important to note that sickness comes at any time. Our people cannot only wait to be sick when they are funds our funds have been dispersed. And so that is an aspect of planning that must be done well. Madame speaker, we want to see our people having water uh as provided by the county government as enshrined uh in the law. We want to have our people getting various services access roads being done uh as uh given um in the devolve functions and madame speaker even in agriculture I'm a farmer madam speaker although a small time but I'm looking forward to getting to big time and I see the way farming is also expensive we want our farmers getting services. We want our farmers getting the right seeds. We want our farmers getting the right extension services advice from the county government because agriculture uh is devolved. Uh, Madame Speaker. So, Madame Speaker, I support this report and we look forward to a time when the issue of funds not in counties will be a thing of the past. Madame Speaker, you often hear in the from our counties in the national news about workers that have not been paid uh for months. We also want to ask our countries uh our county governments that they must do uh good planning that they know already the number of employees they have. They know the required amounts that uh they will be paid in the course of the the years. And so this story of workers, people going without pay is not a good story, Madame Speaker, because these are people who have worked for their governments. These are people who have families, Madame Speaker. These are people who have a number of responsibilities that uh their families look up to them uh to uh perform. So Madame Speaker, I support this and I want to say that Treasury must adhere to the constitutional requirements as enshrined uh in the constitution as per disbbursement of monies to county and the treasury must also uh must also ensure that they do not keep monies up to the last minute when the financial year is ending because We do want money spent well and we do not want to have any reasons for the county governments to get into any improper ways of spending public funds. Madame Speaker, I support Senator Mariam. Uh thank you Madame Speaker for giving me this opportunity. Madame Speaker, I also rise my foot so that to add my voice to this motion of uh cash disbburment schedule uh which was passed by the finance committee. I was one of the members who passed the the schedule. Madame Speaker, Madame Speaker, my concern is uh let territory not take this uh disbbursement as a formal. This is a formality we normally do yearly. Let them not take that. It must be a binding documents that make the treasury to be on toss so that they can remit uh by 15 of every month the way the schedule uh read. Madame speaker, madame speaker in the schedule I realize the highest counties paid is one of them is Mandera County. Madame Speaker, if I take you through the the schedule, July, the Mandera account received 993 m that is million, August 971 million, September 1 billion, October 1 1 billion, November 1 billion, December 981 million, January uh 1 billion, February 1 billion March 9991 981 rather April is 1.1 billion May 1 billion June 981 million Madame speaker this show that we are almost the highest figure the total amount is 12.3 billion madam speaker Madame speaker I'm reading this Because madame speaker in our area there is uh nowadays there is lack of \r\n",

Um, so I'll start I think I'll start from my left. We have Mary Stella Simu who is the Africa senior legal advocacy officer at the International Press Institute. And next to her we have Mutoki Mumo who is the subsaran Africa representative for the committee to protect journalists. And next to me we have Nadin Camp who is a program coordinator at Afia Amani Grand Lux. And next to her on my far right we have Mild Dam who is a climate journalist at the standard group. Um so this is quite a mix of um legal and policy advocates, media freedom advocates, climate environmental journalists and also disinformation experts. So I'm really um excited about this conversation and uh I think um from the session description some of you might have seen that one of the key things we're talking about here is not just climate related disinformation but also the disinformation targeted at journalists that report on climate and the environment. So there's definitely um I think an opportunity to delve deeper into uh the state of climate environmental journalism within Africa. it is important, but also think about how we can address the disinformation relating to climate and also being targeted at the journalists that report um on climate and the environment. And on that note, I'd want to kick off the conversation uh by asking Mary [Music] [Music] Okay. And when I went to the the comment section, there were those who agreed with him. those who added yes you know when it comes to carbon credit those countries who purchase from you know less powerful countries those who are performing better and then still continue damaging the environment and then there are those who just say yes I agree and say no I agree with other things 100% correct and I really wish the media house had done more in the cap in terms of directing that conversation because we need environmental reporters you know directing that conversation because at the end of the day Environmental issues are a very complex issue. Even when you look at the lexicon when we talk about climate change, we talk about biodiversity laws, we talk about pollution, sometimes it becomes one of those things it's hard for the ordinary person to connect with. But really, we can see the tangible consequences of climate change. So for example, we talk about climate change and link it to weather patterns for countries that agriculture is their main income earner. You can see that produce and it's affecting farmers. If you talk about biodiversity loss and think about fish people who make their living from fishing, we have heard that catches have reduced. So you can link the term biodiversity loss uh to to fisheries. Um if you think about pollution, you can think about how there's an increase in respiratory challenges across many African countries which are not there before. And so you can link it with our health complications. And also when I think about this, I remember which a Kenyan journalist told recently that he was taking a drive with a Kenyan politician and the Kenyan politician had a device in his car which he uses to monitor the quality of the air and uh he said that when he's driving in Nairobi he has his windows up because the air quality Nairobi is terrible and we are featured in the top 10 countries globally apparently the worst air quality and he said he asked Round two. It makes me think about the importance of climate and environmental reporting and why we are here today because they are the ones who shape the narrative enough for the public to understand why issues climate change why issues environment actually have an impact on our lives. They have an impact on our livelihood and it's very important to actually have the policy in place to be able to drive change in a way that we are actually protecting our future. We think about our land and we think about how this impacts our future. We need We need a climate and environment reporter to be able to to you know break down this conversation and the discourse and the lexicon around this and the language into narrative that can guide public discourse that can guide public interventions because we see great work happening in communities as well as drive policy action. And so when we ask why it's important at the end of the day it's about our lives and it's about our life. I'm sure we'll discuss this even more but let me stop there. Thank you very much Mary Stella. This was just also for us to appreciate why this conversation is important and I liked how Mary Stella linked it to the importance of climate reporting for communities that are relying for example on agriculture and fisheries for their livelihood but also even you know related links to issues around health. And I also appreciated the example she gave, you know, because I think leaders also public leaders have a role to play in terms of influencing um the climate narrative. And to see, you know, some respected leaders that have quite a strong influence across the globe um actually claiming that some of these climate conversations are hoax and that they are fake news. It's fake news. That's actually quite quite concerning. Um but I want to hand over for highlighting also that link and the importance to journalism because here is a climate journalist and I liked how you highlighted how journalists can shape the narrative and can help communities to understand some of these climate environmental issues. So I just wanted to hear from you um Natilda uh from your perspective especially with regard to the aspect of disinformation itself um as a climate reporter how have you seen this information shape climate narratives or the impact of your work in Africa and also particularly also looking at the role of corporates and states. Thank you uh very much and uh just to give uh confidence in our shipping of narrative to Stella that we're going to do justice to climate is hawks narrative by the Trump president and I hope our our reporting will be more in depth and making sense of what that means to us as journalists and as a continent and well thanks uh back to your question climate disinformation is warped in in the narrative around climate in two ways that I can think of which I've encountered u as a person. The first one is promoting needs like for example Africa's emission is too small to matter or fossil fuel is equal to development. So these are narratives that are often pushed by fossil fuel loists that tend to discourage uh investment in renewables on the continent and also just to confuse the public. And then for the second one is how disinformation impacts us as journalists. That is it targets us directly. I'll share with you an experience whereby I've been personally discredited online for publishing investigative stories around the dredged rivers within the Nile basin and Kenya's caron markets where trolls uh framed me as anti-development. And reading through those trolls, I could easily see them echoing corporate talking points. Um, recently uh we are also seeing the states weaponizing disinformation, accusing journalists of foreign agendas. So we as reporters and generally journalists, we face both distortion of climate facts and also reputational attack that is designed to silence us. So the two tend to weaken public trust in credible reporting and then you find that the two just derail climate action and ultimately for us Fred press freedom. Thank you. Thank you very much Matilda for you know sharing your personal story in terms of how you target that after doing an investigative report. We have seen that actually as part of the monitoring and documentation of attacks that we do at IPI where we look at attacks against um reporters. And we do see some of those coordinated disinformation campaigns where you know there attempts to discredit journalists because of the investigative work that they do and especially with investigative reporting because there are lots of interests also that will be um being protected in in some of those um attempts you know corporate interest interest. Um, so thank you so much for for sharing that that story and I just want to jump quickly still on that conversation on disinformation because Nadine here um she leads a network that does a lot of work around combating disinformation and hate speech in the Great Lakes region. So I want to hear from you Nadine what um has what strategies have worked on the ground um to counter climate disinformation and protect journalists from targeted attacks will be contributing in French. So some of you might need um it's all right. I think is on standby to help us can help us to interpret. [Music] Um, influenc [Music] [Music] going to translate. Um so um the response to that question is twofold. One of the she's going to first um of uh their initiative uh one being um against combating uh disinformation. One being training uh journalists, training influencers and training also community members who actually have a big impact on this information. foreign [Music] local big fake news. So yes, these people, journalists, influencers, community members are the ones that are the most used to spread misinformation, to spread fake news. So in the end what they do is training fact in factchecking and also making sure that the training that they give are in local languages so that people can know how to moderate information in local languages which is not usually done by those mainstream uh medias WhatsApp Tik Tok So one thing they do is um not making sure they they identify which are the social media that have been used to spread fake news and then debunk that information in those same uh social media channels. [Music] [Music] particip. [Music] So, one thing they do is listening to local communities to make sure to identify what is the rumor that's the the most spread, what is the rumor that's most influential, that's actually having the most impact in the community and then they re\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\nclinton global witlative\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:All right. So I feel selfish for being my most famous people and I'm grateful that they're here. I'm going to start with President Asani and a lot of you who live in New York know this but the largest number of Albanians and Kosvors in the world outside the native land are in New York. I have two Osmanis on my street and uh my life has been sort of connected to there since I was president and I'm very very proud of you and your people. You were so young when you were elected and you have managed to accelerate economic growth and I think excuse me increase your security but uh theme of this conference is what's next And you're a walking embodiment of good news. If you do the right thing, give people a chance to have their life and make the most of their life. Most people are good people and they will make the most of it. The covar certainly have. So tell us what's next. Thank you, Mr. president and and good afternoon everyone. It's so good to be back at CGI and and this incredible panel. Um that is not as an easy question for a politician because when we say something then we have to keep our promises. At least we're the kinds that keep their promises. However, um as you rightly pointed out, Mr. President, Kosovo is such an amazing success story, but it's not ours alone. It's yours too and it's the success story of so many allies and friends around the world as I oftenimes mention and I think it's worth mentioning nowadays what the world is facing so many horrible wars and conflicts and so many people are suffering losing their lives and so much destruction that the case of Kosovas shown and it's it's such a great embodiment of what freedom loving nations around the world can achieve when they don't turn a blind They don't turn a blind eye on a people oppressed that is simply trying to live their God's human rights to be free to live their freedom and to have their basic human rights respective and I grew up like everyone else in my generation all the kids of Kosovo initially in an apertike regime then escalated to a genocidal war because of the butcher of the Balkans at that time And to grow up as a child of war, um, of course is the most horrendous thing to anyone. However, when you experience something like that and for the people of Costa experience something like that, it has meant that after the war, after we became free, because of our liberation struggle and your support, Mr. president and the support of the American people and American leadership, we never ever take our freedom for granted. Never. So I believe the fundamental has been to not take our freedoms for granted. And today um over two a little over two decades after we became free and less than two decades after we became independent, Kosovo according to the latest reports is the number one safest country in Europe. number one. Thank you. We're uh number three in the world according to Gallup International Index, number one in Europe and third in the world in terms of safety and security and safety and security and focusing so much on that has also brought economic growth. uh it has brought FDI, it has brought opportunities within the country, it has brought interest, but at the same time it has positioned Kosovo as a reliable ally and partner to other countries in the world because now now we give back. Now we partner with countries with the United States and other countries in Europe and elsewhere and other continents to help those in need. Our soldiers search shouldertosh shoulder with US soldier soldiers in peacekeeping missions around the world. We try to help. We try to share our experience. Our survivors of sexual violence during the war are now traveling the world to support survivors in Ukraine, in Sudan, in other in the Middle East, in other countries. So we're trying to give back while at the same time being very much aware that again freedom even today 26 years after war should not be taken for granted because look at Ukraine for 400 years they had to undergo occupation after occupation and now they need to regain their freedom once again. So we want to make sure and that takes me to what's next. Our biggest bet is on our people. That has always been Kosovo's greatest strength. We have the youngest population in Europe, techsavvy, multilingual, brilliant. They have been taking Kosovo forward the country with highest IT competitiveness rate and that is what is driving our economy and I think that's going to continue to be the driving force beyond behind our economy. But the challenge, the challenge, Mr. President, as you know too well, is maintaining peace. Not just achieving it, maintaining it. We still have a threat in our northern border because Russia's craziness goes well beyond the territories around it and the countries around it. They constantly want to threat of different parts parts of Europe, including the Western Balkans. And this triangle of evil that I call with Russia, China and Iran trying to push forward their malign influence whether through uh military, through economy or through crazy ideology are trying to undo everything that we've achieved together. We need to make sure that the same way that we stopped them so far will continue to stop them uh from now on. So maintaining peace, maintaining peace is a precondition to our continuing success. When you have peace, there's a chance for you to thrive. There's a chance for you to succeed. Whether in economy, in education, in health, internationally, everywhere. When you don't have that, there's simply a lost chance for success for any country, every society elsewhere. And my final point, another reason why KO has been a success story, it's it's women. Women have been at the forefront at the forefront of our peaceful resistance initially, then our arms resistance, our arms struggle, and then ultimately in the peacemaking and the peacekeeping as well as the state building process where women are included and are part of the decision making table. Peace always comes faster and it lasts longer. And that has been, you know, I uh I'm highly prejudically involved with them, but it is true. I have two coar families on the street where Hillary and I live. And our county I think has the highest percentage of Albanians from Albania proper and from Ko stay in. So I'm always given the latest news. But the thing I want all of you to know is there's something wrong when people have to leave their homeland to have normal lives. And in our little town, 3,400 people, all the last four Russians that belong to Albanians, and we have a taco place, most of the employees are Mexicans. of Guatemala, but the owner is a coal baby. And here's the interesting thing. The manager, the woman who gives me a beer every time I walk in the store. And when I was in there after we just opened the two latest restaurants, the woman asked me if I've been to the restaurants. I forgot to run one down, but I haven't got up the hill yet. And she said, I'm Orthodox Christian said, \"Well, you know, this restaurant up the hill belongs to a Muslim and he is a wonderful man and you should go. Why do we all have to leave home and how can we make it safe at home? So I want to thank you. Um now Dr. Pedro and I have been friends for many years because we met when he was the health minister in Ethiopia and our foundation went there to set up an AIDS program and to help them to build out a health system that was quite good and out of but didn't have enough presence in a massive number of rural communities they had and I thought Then said that probably got him in trouble. I said I would be really I would have been proud if this president he had been the secretary of health and human services in America. Today he'd have worked on getting jobs and vaccines but this man has been through all the challenges globally plus he had family to cry with all the problems that had happened within Ethiopia. He's had to live through that. Keep running the World Health Organization and watch others try to take advant health. What can you still do? What do you need help doing? What can this group do to help? Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for reminding me the days when you supported me in challenge when I was um the impact of your intervention still is felt. So thank you. Um currently of course we're passing through a very difficult uh situation um difficult times some call it call it interesting times it positive um as some of you may know the US has withdraw from the and I was actually in Tanzania when I heard the news in Tanzania to fight the M outbreak. Marb is like um and I read the executive order and four reasons put there. um the four reasons for the withdrawal actually are four good reasons to stay in that for the US and I was surprised and still we haven't had any direct discussion otherwise if these are the reasons I think it's actually good reasons to stay but that action is loose loose for the US so globally the question you asked US is withdrawn makes the US unsafe and makes the world unsafe as well. It's all of course even after withdrawal the US asks us for information on outbreak on this surveillance we share. We don't even ask any question because at the end of the day we want the safety of the American people because that's our nothing else. uh but since then we're moving forward and I have already proposed to the member states a revised budget significantly lower which removes the US contribution completely and based on the new budget in Europe we have already designed a new structure we have completed prioritization and we shaped up the organization starting from the top leadership reducing the size of the senior leadership by have and the prioritization has already been completed and reached already at the front line. Um and we're as we speak giving notifications annually to our staff who are leaving which really pains me because as the whole world knows um these are the same staff that just staff who have been working during pandemic day and night under serious pressure. They don't deserve this visit. That's what uh because it it's not but of course we have done all the uh process by following three principles uh transparency, fairness and humanity and in a way that maintains the core mandate of the organization. But although the whole process is painful because sending out my colleagues is painful. On the other hand, we see opportunity in this crisis. We see opportunity to strengthen the organization. We see opportunity to focus the organization on Monday but learn to work for others and even learn even if we are less than what we used to be with less to do more. And it's possible and it's an opportunity as well to make the organization independent because we should avoid in the future similar shocks and the main reason or the main challenge or risk for her which we have analyzed in 2017 and 2018 and we have been working to address that. Dependency on traditional donors is the main cause and whenever the major donor withdraws a shock like this happens but not only that with big amount of money coming from you can compromise your independence as well. So for the future what we are trying to do is develop map that we have prepared using this as opportunity to make the organization shock proof to prevent talks like this in the future by broadening the donor base and we are doing that and also make it independent when the donor base is broadened. We can absorb shocks but at the same time can be independent and our member states when we proposed this this is before When this crisis happened in 2022, they approved an increase of membership by 50%. And that's actually helping us during this crisis to minimize the impact. If it wasn't for this finance, we would have laid off more than double of the staff we're laying off now. So the reform is working and we're looking at it as opportunity. So we're moving forward. So there is the pain but there's the opportunity and I I I am confident that we can make the organization better. But we are not really worried about who of course the one is there. It's less of a problem than the impact of the US funding cuts for other countries on on developing world especially you know the services which have been affected now HIV, TB, malaria um and other uh programs um even you know in those countries I think lives are in because of the funding cuts. Um so the solution we are now agreeing which I I hope the you know I I I'm I'm encouraged that the countries are taking it seriously is um countries should move into their lands um and mobilize domestic resources and see this as opportunity to uh that and we're helping them with mobilizing domestic resources for instance alcohol and tobacco taxes will be the immediate and for the long term also insurance systems because there are resources that can help with this and for me as an African of course not only Africa as a developing countries but as an African I think Africa doesn't need charity it's fair terms solidarity and cooperation and I I'm not I'm glad I'm glad to see that in many meetings even during this anger many leaders saying um the same thing and taking the steps uh to move uh forward. So both for and for the countries affected. I think this is impacting and we're really losing lives. But let's see as an opportunity and let's have a strategic solution that can prevent future similar challenges from happening. Thank you. By the way, there's one thing I want to stress. Sorry again. There is one thing I want to stress. US and any government have the right to use its money the way it wants. The only thing from that we asked at the time was the US would have given some exit strategy instead of sudden cut 6 months or one year that would have addressed the problems we're facing now and could have saved the lives that we had we had lost. So the country has every right to use its mind the way it wants but it should not have been silent and there should have been a kind of transition but for me I think the answer is self self reliance and we can do resources and those donors who can support can focus on building so that countries should not get fish but should learn how to fish from the donors Thank you so much. I first met Chef Jose Andre more than 25 years ago when I was still president back in the dark ages. I just had a little poly. He was living in Washington DC and he came to help do a community feeding around. And Hillary and I went out to the site and serve food. And I'm not this guy ever was an immigrant in Spain. And I was totally blown away. I mean, most people who came to America trying to make their way didn't think about what they could do. and show the road to help other people who needed help. He did and I watched him for years and after I got out of the White House, we started working together all over the world just by accident because of the work I did in places where he was active. And I have been amazed to see the speed with which he has built a system that can serve huge numbers of people in distressed areas. And when I was worried about the CO epidemic, World Triple Kitchen put a food distribution operation in a parking lot at my library in Arkansas because we had a lot of low income people and he trusted us to deliver the food beyond the size of people who couldn't get there. And so we wound up between the two of us probably serving almost a million in just that one spot. And I watched this guy pull rabbit over and over and over again. God knows we need a lot of rabbits pulled out of our house today. So now what are we going to do friends? How are we going to keep going? How can we do more? How can we meet the needs? How do keep going? I think you know we're living in a moment that the clock is at zero. So let's see if they do this that at times you feel like you don't want to wake up in the morning because when you see all the great things is great when you see all the things are not so great I don't know if you have that feeling that brings you down a little bit and now is not the time to let the situation anywhere in the world bring us down. If anything, this is what it means to motivate us to be all next to each other to say there is not going to be a problem we cannot solve if we work together with books and how you said I saw you do when you were visiting this central kitchen 25 years ago when we met with action. U Kitchen is not a fighting hunger organization. is a emergency food relationship and we specialize in showing up quick and fast and solving the food issues immediately. I just came back from visiting my team in Gaza. We we already committed 100 million uh dollars. This going to help us do 1 million meals a day. um 1 million meals a day over the next year. We have um 60 community kitchen. We have two more kitchen um major kitchens. Next week, we're opening two more. This week, today we reach 427,000 meals. By the end of next month, we will be able to be reaching at very least 600,000. And before the end of the year, we are reaching 1 million meals. This is what makes The people the people of Gaza are in our opinion. They want our respect. Western doesn't feed anybody. Is the thousands of Palestinians working with us, feeding Palestinians. That's the way to do it. But at the same time, good for me. In the first day, we were in Israel. Why? Because it was the right thing to do. Because the people of Israel needed our aid. The next day we were in Gaza. Why? Because the people of Gaza needed our aid. What is good for you must be good for me. When they ask me, why are you in Israel? Are you pro-Israeli? Say yes. Why are you in Gaza? Are you pro Palestinian? I say yes. The only way we're going to be solving the problem is if we are Thank you. We we we partner with UN feed a lot of hospitals. Uh we are with a doctor called Dr. Hassan the new hero is 6 6,500 orphans. Um we are finishing next week the first uh home and a school for 1,600 and in the next 60 days we'll have the orphanage three orphanage for 6,500 children finished. This is not just giving a speech. We will do it. We are already building it and giving home to those orphans in the middle of the world inside Gasa. This is what keeps people motivated. You believe in the promise of very we are in Ukraine. Uh we are still in Ukraine. We were in Ukraine day one. We were in BHA day one. We were in person day one. We are now in the front lines mainly especially elderly. They are too elderly to move. So we make sure we are delivering around 300,000 meals a day to people that they are too old to go anywhere anymore. So we are there making sure that we support all the people that um we are um at the same time we've been supporting things like school kitchen. The first lady of Ukraine needed help filling with the schools. So uh it's been many people helping but we support a big major kitchen in Charih in the north and a big kitchen in the south in person. And with those two major kitchens we are able to be fitting multiple schools in a very big area and is the most safe way to be doing it. This is the way we keep doing it Mr. President. But the thing I'm the happiest Haiti I fall in love with Haiti will find it in Haiti. I feel I let down Haiti in the way that it's so much more we can all do around Haiti. This kind of beautiful place, beautiful people. So, we've been putting a lot of emphasis in making sure that in this situation in Haiti things go better. The best way to take care of the future of our country is taking care of the children. So, we we we we've been establishing already over the last year. We are right now in 700 schools feeding children with 700 kitchens but making sure that all the food is bought from farmers around every one of the school in the process of children we strengthen the local is no  we are doing it anybody can go and watch what we doing with local partners that know um what they are doing and you said when I say we committed 100 million here in C I just heard a met from Sudan move to LA. My daughter President was in chat and Sudan my young daughter working with Wford program and my daughter has been telling me daddy we have to go to Sudan we need to help Sudan we have to be in Sudan and I'm and just listening to Hanim here and that's why it's so important here in CI. I'm going to be committing with the fund I have under tables $1 million to the initiative of But this is what you've been doing for all of us. Uh, Mr. President, uh, call to action. It's okay we clap. But if you leave now and you do nothing until next year and you come here and clap again, please don't make things happen. And if you don't know what, look around you. You will have somebody next to you that will show you the way. I don't do anything. I only find people that show me the way. They I'm not empowering them. They are the ones empowering me. That's all. in many places and I have seen and set up these operations and then I've watched politicians screw it up very important. We fed a lot of people in Haiti, but they didn't take advantage of it. And we had a great feeding station on the border of Venezuela and Colombia, which is wildly successful. But there's still problems there. And that's I want to shift back now to our other panels. there. The world has always changed. In the 20 years since we've been doing CGI, it's a very different world on almost every continent. And there are places that are better off, but there are a lot of places that are more so. So, I want to start with you, Madame President. A lot of people thought I was nuts when I got involved in coastal and I told them I said you watch this would be the only place in the modern world where a war has ever been won through our air power because the cultivars will never and eventually will become too expensive for the serves to continue to fight and we'll save more lives. So, you've already succeeded beyond a lot of people's wildest dreams, but you were the first born president. You're the youngest president. How are we going to You look ahead. You look at all the things. Look at what's happening in World Health for example. What have you done and what do you think other countries should do to make sure that those who are on the right path stay there and get the support they need? Because I know you think about this. We do. We do every day. And I would say um the the easiest thing is to try to teach others how to do things. But uh it's uh probably not my place to do that rather than be a hand of support to those who need us right now. And there are plenty of countries that are going through what we have to go through. And um you know listening to what you had to say earlier, it reminded me of you know millions of people around the world who came to our rescue in our time of need. And you know today I might be speaking as president but you know years ago I was that child waiting in the line for food and that child waiting in the line for the support uh from the WH. So the children that you're helping today the women that you're helping today will be sitting here tomorrow. Um so my first My first point would be let's not stop let's not stop the help let's not stop the support for those most in need until the moment when they can get to live in peace and you said it rightly that most of ours would never bend we would never bend because you know we were a nation uh that endured occupation for initially for 500 years and then for another 100 and something years. And not any kind of occupation, not the kind of occupation that simply tries to push forward their language. The kind kind of occupation that tries to extinguish you and tries to just destroy you as a nation and deny your existence. that despite of hundreds of years of occupation, we never lost our identity. We never stopped fighting for our right to exist. And the example of the United States of America and other countries around the world standing by Kosovo has turned into such a success story because today Kosovo is such a strong democracy. It's such a resilient nation. as they said, a strong economy and a country that can deal with challenges. Of course, we have the support of friends because no nation can make it alone, no matter how big or small, but also a testament that smaller nations too can have an impact because we should not be defined by by our geography alone, but our impact should be defined by the story that we have to tell. So we continue to share this with the rest of the world without trying to patronize them because everyone has their own story and that is different obviously from ours. But we try to help them in becoming a resilient democracy. No matter how imperfect the system of democracies is, becoming a resilient democracy can help you then deal with the rest of the challenges so that we don't go back. There will always be forces that will try to set us back. God knows we have them in our own region. But when you're you have very strong foundations, foundations built on freedom, rule of law, democracy, and human rights that will help you deal with the challenges. And that's what what we try to share with the rest of the world. Because even in becoming a strong economy, our rule of law, democracy, and human rights efforts come out of this. Even when gaining support from the rest of the world, the rule of law, democracy and human rights have helped us. They have to go hand in hand. Even when we strive to become members of the European Union, our message is that you know EU values should go hand in hand with the EU cash, with the EU economic support. If you don't meet those values, if you don't fight for those values, you shouldn't get the economic support the EU provides. But that is the model that we try to share as I said without trying to patronize anyone because different countries, different regions, different continents face different challenges. But what we've learned is that when you never take your freedom, your freedoms in general for granted. When you focus on rule of law, democracy and human rights, economic empowerment and prosperity comes. And third, your strength ultimately lies in your partnerships. You need partners, you need allies, you need friends. And what you stand for and who you stand for in the most difficult times matters a lot. Uh and at the same time, give back. You know, you have to give back. One day Ukraine will regain its freedom, its total supranity. and it will be strong again. It's so important that they give back and support other nations that will be facing uh such similar similar divisions the same way that Kosovo today is supporting Ukraine. Kosovo is supporting nations around the world that are facing the same. And I mean I wish I didn't have to speak after you because I thought that should have been the conclusion. I I can't stress enough how important it is to say you don't have to be in politics to make a huge change in the world. You don't have to have an important position to do great things like what we've heard. Feeding a child that is in need changes more than just one life. It changes societies. It changes the world in its entirety. uh so much more than all of the speeches together that we had hold. So, thank you for what you do. I can't explain how much it means to those children because I've been one of them. I've been so over the spring is going to slow I don't want to end the Because if you think about it, his story at the end will be either the happiest or the saddest of all because he became the first African to lead the World Health Organization. men of unquestioned medical confidence and honor and honesty only to find not only world under assault but his native land divided by fresh conflict over divisions that affected his own family. I called him one day just to see how his family was getting on in Ethiopia and he didn't know. He couldn't get the news. And think how you feel if you weren't there. You couldn't find out about your family. You've given your whole life to this cause and then as soon as it seemed to calm down a little an existential threat to the World Health Organization emerged in the form of people. He's had to do that. So, how have you kept going and how do you think they will get other young people from Africa, young men and women to be trained as health workers and go into this war? Yeah. Thank you. Of course, the war in Ethiopia say it well. I myself and myself a war child. Um I was in Yemen last year, last December, December 26. And I was there leading a UN mission to negotiate with the to release our UN colleagues who have been detained by them. And while I was leaving SHA, the SHA was under attack by Israeli drones. So I survived narrowly. It was close. Two people in the town were killed and aviation colleague was wounded was close. Um and at that time what came to mind was not what was happening then the attack or the sound I heard that very end everybody was disturbed and we were running for our lives. But what came to mind is my memories from childhood. The smell the image even the sun. This is what we call. But that made me feel not just for myself, but I was in Jenna and our colleagues pass through this every single day. But I experienced it just for a few minutes and still takes me back in a memory lane. And then if you take Gaza, he was saying it I can't imagine how the cousins could live in that situation with Miss Bombardment every day. Um, and in my country as well, I'm a war child and when my kids were growing up, there was war and now there is war and I lost even closest families including my uncle. Um probably that situation not only understanding I mean the impact on me but understanding what's happening to the rest like the Gaza or in the you know those who under conflict that helps me to understand in the right perspective and probably encourage me to do more as an individual Yeah. So it's not about me but about what's happening for others and which is even more serious than what's happening to me. But there was even recently um in 2020 that's when the US withdrawal the first round came and there was war in my country and there was covid at the height of co it was a difficult situation um but if there is one thing that I try to um see then is of course this is the situation it's beyond my control but how can I understand the situation and focus on what I can do and that keeps me going I think that's the question but more importantly I think Jose has done probably more if you have a mentality of humanity first and that can give you some balance Fox are trickling out. That means we need to end this. Let's give a small hand. Please welcome Welcome to the stage David Fagenbomb. Growing up, I was always interested in health and medicine, but it wasn't until I lost my mom to brain cancer during college and I made it my life's mission. In our final conversation, I promised her that I'd dedicate my life to finding treatments for other patients facing deadly conditions. But a few years later, during back to school weekend, I found myself in the ICU dying from a disease with no treatments. I nearly died five times over the next three and a half years.\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ncultwj сна\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:25 and tourism. So today is Thursday until the 25th of September 2025. So to me first press briefing will be addressed by ambassador or Liberal representative to the mo and Julius Kobar Liber of President. So they're just showing how this welcome TV lab is taking us don't you go away to bring you full coverage of my cat regular rest briefing keep following police our guest Facebook followers, radio listeners, we like to welcome you to the CH William press hall where our regular Tuesdays and Thursday press briefings are held this afternoon. The presiding officer for today's press briefing is Liberus Deputy Information Minister for Press and Public Affairs, Honorable Daniel Sando. Minister Sando is here along with the acting minister of information, cultural affairs and tourism honorable Johnny Tap. Today press briefing will play host to Liberia's feminine representative to the international maritime organization based in London, Ambassador Ra Mosio Pal. Ambassador Pal will provide you update on the summit that is expected to be held in Liberia. The president of the president of Liberia, Mr. Dr. Judas Kaba will also come and talk about the president Labua anniversary. Without much ado, I'd like to invite Labua Deputy Spok Honorable Daniel Sando who will speak to you on progress made by the government both local and internationally. Good afternoon all of you. Good afternoon to your various audiences. We are happy to be back here behind this microphone in the historic Charles Buon Hall. And I want to say thanks to all of you for taking seriously the job, the piece of assignment that you have to execute at the ministry. Many of you come on time making sure that your gadgets are in place to provide courage for the government press conference. We also want to say thanks to radio stations that are relaying answer your questions provide you updates on a regular basis. So today we have and like family said we have two distinguished gentlemen in our m one does not need any introduction he is the president of the press union of Liberia Mr. Julius Kona we like to welcome you Mr. econom is here to just come in P anniversary. So he's he ain't come to talk government business yet come to use his platform because you know the ministry of information is a sector ministry for all library journalists. The ministry of information is the sector ministry for all Liberian journalists. And so when the president of the president of Liberia made a request and say okay we want to come to pass an announcement for the upcoming anniversary of the P can't say no to that. So what we'll do we'll kind of deviate from our regular protocol here the president announcement I'm not too sure you have question for him but if you have question he will take one or two and then he will leave us so we can talk about government matter also here is uh the honorable Robert Mal somebody who used to work here before but now in different capacity Liberia's permanent representative to the international maritime organizations and when you hear about all of the the transformation that Liberia can now boast of in the maritime sector talking about reelection back to category A the upcoming AMA conference Mr. Ra Pal is the progenitor of all of these reform. So he's here to talk about it and uh we want to welcome Honorable Pallet and his team to the refurbished conference room. Yeah. So as I indicated, I will now take my seat while I invite to the podium the president of the president of Liberia. We see what he has to say. He will leave and then I will come to do some housekeeping and then honorable pal will make his presentation and we jointly entertain questions from members of the press that are here. Mr. President, thank you very much uh Minister Sando for uh your kind words and for uh the introduction. So I would like to stand on existing protocol but also to state that uh the permanent rep um to the IMO uh he's a member of the fraternity. So um Mr. P yeah we extend our greetings uh to colleagues uh in the media from different media organizations. We like to say uh warm greetings to all of you. Uh it's good to be at the ministry of information, cultural affairs and tourism. Uh I know you're in your political season. I'm told uh tomorrow uh you'll be conducting a process here if all goes well, right? Uh so we are wishing you the best in terms of your decision making um to electing the new leadership. So it's good um to be here to be given this opportunity uh to speak um with you and to you. Uh I also like to thank uh minister fam acting minister I hope he becomes minister proper yeah for yeah affording us this opportunity uh we've been in talks a lot uh so colleagues of the media uh we wish to again restate the position of the union uh in terms of the anniversary celebrations. So on yesterday we officially announced that celebrations of the union's 61st anniversary will take place on Tuesday September 30 2025 that's next week. The celebrations will be held in Morovville and the theme of the celebration is commemorating our past constructing our future. We are happy to announce that the resident representative of the office of the Equas Commission in Liberia, Ambassador Joseph will serve as the keynote speaker. This year's anniversary is intended not only to honor the legacy of the PU in advancing press freedom and journalist rights but crucially to underscore the union's resource mobilization initiative for the construction of a national headquarters and that national headquarters will be known as the Staton Peab body media house. as I was coming in here uh the permanent rep said he's willing to make his contribution uh so we are happy that different people in society are contributing towards the construction of the P headquarters so the program on Tuesday will begin with a parade uh at 10 a.m. From the Capitol Hill campus of the University of Liberia to the P new hair office at Wan Avenue N Street in Sinko. It will be followed by indoor ceremonies starting at 12 p.m. So, three colors of t-shirts uh and caps have been approved and put on sales. I hope some of you already have your t-shirts. If not, you have to go because demand is high and supply may be limited on the eve or during the celebrations. Uh so the three t-shirts are in different colors like I said red, white and blue. So those color collectively symbolize uh or symbolizes those colors collectively uh symbolizes the continuing resistance against anti-free speech press practices through calmness relevant resource mobilization committee encourages all journalists and members of the P media practitioners across Liberia, inclusive of media workers and communication practitioners to join the celebrations and we need to take very seriously the solemn generation of journalists project to construct our headquarters that is the future permanent home of the press union of Liberia. So just a small background, the PUL as many of us know was founded in Monrovia on 30th September 1964. It was formed to advocate for press freedom and the protection of journalists. The breath of the P was a long struggle. It grew out of a crisis with the legislature. Journalist Taton Piboli as we said had written an article critical of the lawmakers. He said to refer to the lawmakers as radicals. So he was held in contempt, arrested and due. So he colleagues immediately mobilize solidarity action in support of Staton. So going forward the P has been existing for those number of years. So we are happy to live on that legacy. So colleagues in the media, we hope to see all of us at the anniversary celebrations. Again, we like to say thanks uh to the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism and all of our dignitaries uh who we've invited. They've confirmed their participation. So we look forward to seeing you. As the minister said, maybe if you have any questions, you have to come to the office, right? So, I'll leave you. Thank you, minister. Thank you, Minister. Thanks, police. So just just before we as the PR president honorable Julius Cannaba announcement and I I'm sure that the ministry of information will be fully represented. So we are wrapping up analysis on the president's presentation at the UN General Assembly and I then begin some rounds on the radio station. Many thanks to the publishers that have made it a duty to highlight portion of the speech delivered by the president at the 80th section of the United Nation General Assembly. The president's speech was a collection of critical concerns from the perspective of Liberia. He was well presented. He started by welcoming the election of Liberia as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2026 2027 term. The president indicated that this tenure to the council mark a significant step for Liberia's progress. 80 years after Liberia signed the charter of the United Nation, the president went on to reassured the world that although the office will be occupied by Liberians but the seat belong to Africa. He noted that Liberia will contribute to discussions and decisions that will shift our highend experiences in conflict resolution as well as our successes in peace building and democratic reform. The president threw light on wars in the Middle East, Europe, the displacement, climate change and indicated that these are challenges and no country can solve alone. He stressed the need for continuous effort to uphold multilateralism in transiting business at the United Nation. on the war in Europe in the Middle East. The president reminded the UN that peace is often fragile and must be consistently defended. He said forcing his support for all credible means for mediation efforts aimed at resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the Israeli and Palestine conflict. The president reinforced the common African position for a two-state solution in resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Liberia stands behind the common Afr\r\n",

I am not anybody. I am just a man of God, born again and saved. But a man who knows his God. And the Bible says those who know their God, they shall be strong and they shall do exploit. And so I was waiting to do that. But anyway, it was so mesmerizing and so humiliating because they're asking me for everything. I hope I gave somebody to to have a a little clip that I forgot a good one that somebody can I don't know whether media you have by clip I send you some I hope you have if you have it please organize and we show these people as I finish quickly and um so that I don't become a storyteller you know when you are young like me you have a lot of stories and experiences and explanations but I let me hope I'm going to inspire you by what I'm saying okay that looks like uh yes um now that's the the the community um and of course we have even gone to another community in Uganda called Karamoa who are primit uh who are marginalized and we are doing the same let's have a clip can make it louder in farms schools adult literacy renewal and women's empowerment to uplift entire communities. Anchored in John 10:10, this brings light to the darkest corners of Africa, enable the vulnerable and marginalized to experience true life in abundance. CIM's biblically empowered worldview is more than just a model. It is a movement worth replicating for community transformation across the globe. In our strategy we think about two things. One is modeling and the other is medicine. Modeling is where we believe that every success we have to come to a place where we identify the people with potential. Most times we find people working in our communities look at the people who are most but we look at the people because it is them who serve as models in those communities. Once we have people who have changed that we can see that we can identify with others. We had two three villages that we done and using those villages we grow them to 12 20 now there 80 villages most of the families are 1 2 3 or four five small D and they can now for two years it is very possible to reg it is very possible so when we bring people to RA and they see the work that is going on with people who had been previously relying on food aid, they become so inspired. If you can do it in a place like this that has only maybe three weeks of rain in a year, I know that I can do this back at home in Tanzania on my small farm. If it could be done in the driest plateaus of Kenya, it can be done in other regions, especially in Africa. coming down. I know I'm down. Thank you. Now that's not Yata. That's about Pot and Karamoja in Uganda where now going to POT. Now that's the area the dry area. Now we are having over 20 mission stations with the churches, schools and training center. Last week I was there with the governor of the area. Now because of Christian presence the government has made a road passing through their place. When I went 100 kilometers 200 kilometers I took two days. Now I take two hours because marginalization is a devil element. I went to the government to the national government to the county government to the governor and the roads are made. They have helped me to make dams for ev for most of the people. Now they are build schools or they helping me also to build schools. And when I'm going there is like a president from a certain universe is coming because I am not normal. Aha. You are not normal. You are not normal. You can do greater things. And that's what I want you to do. Not to sing choruses all the time and jump around. Yes. Singing I will sing. Dancing I would dance. But what you do after dancing you must do something. We can change this society. Last time when I was here somebody called me a day like today and said me you want the government wants to honor you as a national hero. I said, \"Okay, give them the details.\" They were given. When I went, I was honored. When I was just coming from my uh from the room, they said, \"There's another one that they want to honor you.\" I don't want the honor. I but I want to, but I not going to refuse them because I want the world to know I can beat them in their world. Are you hearing? We can develop competitive advantage over everyone. Why? Mhm. Why? Why should we have competitive advantage? I want you to listen to me now. Quickly, let's go back to Acts chapter 6 verse one. I'm not going to give you another example. Now, that's enough for you today. Now, in the book of um um of Acts chapter 6 verse 1, in those days uh the number of disciples was multiplied there. There was the mammarine. There was a social problem in Jerusalem. There was a social problem. And there therefore there was a need for solution. There was a need. There is a problem in Nigeria, in Africa, in Kenya, everywhere. And there is a need. There is a need for somebody to arise, for somebody to stand up and solve the problem. There is a vacancy. There is a fancy I want to say to all of you tonight and I'm speaking to you. I'm speaking to you. There's a fancy. There is a fancy choir somewhere. somebody to raise out of this congregation and go and sort out not even a spiritual mess a social mess. So there was a problem and um there was a need for social there was a social services vacancy. Seven fancies were needed and um and um because because the pastors the bishops on this side were very busy you know praying and uh preaching that's what they are saying. So there was a need for somebody from this side. Seven guys, seven people to come out and out of here as you listen to me. I am looking for seven guys, seven women, seven men. It doesn't matter today who stand up and identify a social problem, a political problem and go and sort out. That's why we are full of the Holy Ghost. I am full of the Holy Ghost. When I was when I because I'm full of the Holy Ghost. I went to Anaso Desert Ja and now it's a place everybody's going the world, you know, United Nation World Bank. Everybody's there. Everybody's asking me to be a consultant. But I'm too busy also doing the missionary work. But I don't refuse because I have a big team who go and work for me. So what I'm saying is um I am talking about you you you developing strategic uh competitive and advantage in this world. Competitive now strategic competitive and advantage in this world. And so the the business there was to ser the guys can Peter and John and others could go on preaching. And I want you to get number three verse three. Therefore, brethren, look out. Seven men honest. Underline underline the word hest. honest. Mhm. So the guys who are needed these are the qualification and the max after the interview you're going to pass the three if not four wholeness and of good report full of holy ghost like you. How many are full of the Holy Ghost? Wonderful. You might qualify and uh wisdom. Mhm. whom we may appoint over this business. So God is looking for man with three now qualities out of this congregation. I'm not teaching I am not teaching new theology. I don't do that. I am looking for you. I'm looking for you because I am not a good speaker. I am not at all. I can call you nonsense. I'm not very good. You remember I called you nonsense last time. Okay. I'm not a very good speaker. Yes. But I'm a good mobilizer. I'm a good organizer. I'm a good mover. And if I speak and you say like they say, \"Oh, you spoke nicely. I spoke in Nairobi uh two months ago in a big um now um pastors and bishops and apostles and and prophets conference.\" And after that everybody was calling me. Oh, that was great. We want to hear you. Everybody's calling me. I said I'm not a I'm not a good speaker. I am organ I am agonizer. Can I hear that word? An organizer. Yes. And that's what I want to get out of this. We are doing dilly dealing dealing dealing darling. I want us to get out and solve the problem that we were given yesterday. the statistic given in the in the in the you know in Africa and uh and change Africa and I am sure we are we are good for the task and so seven men were chosen. Seven men were chosen and one of them is Steven. Was he mentioned? Was Steven mentioned there in verse three? Um yeah, let's go to um verse verse 8. Let's leave a few here because of time. Verse 8. Steven was among the seven. Steven was among the seven. That's why saying the book of Steven which is not there. Full of faith. Can I hear the word?

Welcome to Ownership Conference 2025. I think we are on day three. Is it day three? All right. It feels like we've been here for a week. My goodness.

I'm just I'm allergic to all these movements. Just settle down quickly. Amen. Settle down in Jesus name. I rebuke restless spirit. You know, stop walking around. Amen. Amen. Praise God. All right. Okay, quickly I just have a few assignments to do and um we'll get that out of the way because we really we have two powerful sessions today. One of my favorite, you know, gospel ministers in the world is in the house. I tell you, you know, I I I just admire him. Admire the way that God has used him to be a blessing to our generation. His songs at all times will bring tears in your eyes. And I remember one of the I think it was some concert you did in UK. I was like Kados I was listening to that song and I was weeping like a child. I was in Dubai airport. I will never forget in uh Dubai. Yeah. Emirates. And um when I got there, my flight was delayed. So I began to play. That was when you released Emperor of the Universe. I listened to that song more than 100 times with tears all over my eyes. And I said one day this guy is coming to House of and by the grace of God. Hallelujah. You know, you know the amazing thing. Let me let me tell on him. Can I tell on you? Yeah. Let let me tell on him. So, so I've called him. He we've spoken. Don, please come. Come to Macedonia. Come and help us. Come to South Africa. I will call Don. Hey, he is so busy. I called him. He said he was in Canada with Apostle Joshua. He was here. He was there all over the world. And you know, I then got tired. Somebody say, \"I got tired.\" Mhm. Then I'm in Kenya with Apostle Joshua Selman. We were together. We went to dedicate a building. We just left there. While we entered the car, I was driving behind my wife and I were in the car behind Apostle Joshua. My phone rings. Who is it? Dons. I said I told my wife I said this one Dunson is calling me. Dons says ah man of God the Lord wants me to be in your meeting. Haha. Ah, I my wife is there, baby. I just I said to my wife, I love Jesus. In fact, I was saying it to you on the phone. I say, I love Jesus. He went to speak for me. Men of God, you are welcome to South Africa once again. Oh my God. Your songs have been a blessing. We have stepped into dimensions with your songs. Our choir sings your songs literally almost every service. Amen somebody. Hallelujah. Please allow me to just welcome all the five-fold ministry gift. If you are a pastor, uh a prophet, evangelist, teacher, uh bishop, apostle, pope, you know, please can you all stand? Let's just welcome you. Please can we just celebrate them? Let's celebrate them. Let's celebrate all the servants of God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being with us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being with us. Amen. We truly truly appreciate you. Praise the Lord. Now, um I'm going to do the offering, but there's two parts to this offering. And um I spoke to you, I think it was 2 days ago. The Lord, you know, would have me do something that I've never ever done in any ownership conference. and um he said to me, \"I want you to receive an offering for the guest speakers.\" And that was very strange for me because um you know I'm not you know that kind of person but he said to me I should do it. So this morning I'm this evening I'm going to receive a special offering for all our ministers. Everyone who has been here to minister instead of when conference finish you start queuing up to drop offering. It's very embarrassing. Amen. Let's do it right here in church. Can I hear an amen? All right. Uh give me the book of uh third John or Yeah. Third John uh and uh verse 5. Third John and verse 5. Give it to me in the New Living Translation. Please pay attention everybody. Please settle down. Just sit still. Amen. Third John and verse 5. He says, \"Dear friends, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who passed through who came through South Africa to ownership conference.\" The Bible says even though they are strangers to you, Naz, he said they have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that does what to God? So that means that there is a kind of giving you give to people who God sent to you to minister to you that pleases him. Are we reading Bible? Uh-uh. You see when you talk about money your voice goes down. If I say receive now amen. Are you here? All right. It says next verse. For they are traveling for the Lord. Who are they traveling for? So when when Dunson left Nigeria to come here today, who did he travel for? The Lord. And he says, \"And they accept nothing from people who are not believers.\" So what God is saying is that he does not expect unbelievers to take care of them. He does not he does not expect unbelievers to look after them. Please put back stop showing me what is your challenge. He says, \"So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as they do what they teach the truth.\" This is the will of God. Somebody say amen to that. Now, do you believe the Bible? Do you believe that what I just read is the Bible? All right. First Timothy chapter 5 and verse 17, same New Living Translation. 1 Timothy chapter 5 verse1 17 the Lord woke me up in the middle of the night while I was preparing you know just pray praying for service two nights ago I told you guys he says elders who do their work well should be respected and what else you see unfortunately we are in a generation that you are a believer but you are listening to people on social media Listen to Bible. Listen to what God said. We we we are a people that believe in the word of God. The Bible said that elders who do their work well should be respected. And what else? Uh don't say it with jealousy or with anger. It's not my fault that God did not call you. They must be what? I want you to shout, \"Let the devil hear you.\" They must be what? Paid well. It says, \"Especially those who work hard at both what? Preaching and teaching.\" Next verse. For the scripture says, you must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain. And in another place, those who work deserve what? What do they deserve? You know, it's amazing how the society or our world think that pastors are not important. the work of ministry. We are just a people that sit down and enjoy ourself. Sometimes when I I I hear people say, you know, these pastors all they are doing is enjoying. My question is come and enjoy with me. Start a church. Let's see. I mean, if you think it's easy, just do it. Are you hearing me? Somebody do it. You know, but this is the scriptures. He says, next verse, next verse, he said, \"Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless is confirmed by two or three witnesses.\" Somebody say, \"Amen.\" Amen. Now, God has sent us these people. I believe there is a reason after 10 years of this conference for me to do this the first time. This is the first time. Some of you have been attending this conference. I've never done what I'm doing. It was an instruction given to me. I want every head to bowed. Give me envelopes. Give me envelopes. Every head bowed or eyes closed. Just give me envelopes. I want to call for a few people or those who say I want to sew. Please give me envelopes. Ash ushers. I want to call for some people here. And you say, \"Apostle, I'm willing to thank you. I have to do this. My guest speakers, I don't expect them to do this. So, I have to do it.\" Amen. And I'm not afraid of you. Amen. You must know that. Praise God. You know, the people in in the world or in darkness, they finance all their projects. That's the truth. They fund all that they do. And the gospel is to be funded by us as God's people, not unbelievers. I don't expect a Muslim to come in here and give me, well, I expect and if it happens, I won't say no. Amen. But nonetheless, the the according to God's order, it is us who are here that are supposed to do this. As your heads are bowed, I want you to just pray in the spirit for a minute or two. Lord, what would you want me to sow? What would you want me to give? Most times after our conference is so embarrassing for us to have Apostle Joshua just wait people are queuing up to give and now you are doing it here. You don't have to be you know we don't need all that drama. Every offering we are receiving now is going to go to our guest speakers. Can I hear an amen? Can I hear an amen? Now I know bloggers are going to take what I I'm saying, they will misrepresent it. That's their problem. I don't care about them. I care about the kingdom of God. Whatever they say about me, I have thick skin now. My skin is like elephant. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out. So, you know, I I don't care what they say. You are here today and you say, \"Apostle, I can do a,000 to $10,000 as an offering to our guest speakers.\" Just where you are, raise up your hand. You can do $1,000 to $1,000 is $17,000 rand is that much? 17,400 or 18 less 18,000. You can do that. Please can you step out and collect this envelope from me? Please step out. Step out. Collect this envelope. No. No. No. No. Hey. Hey. Don't clap. Don't clap. It's not a clapping matter. This is a serious matter. You should be praying, not clapping. Doctor, stand here. Don't go anywhere. Stand. Stand here. Please don't go. Please don't go. You already have your $1,000. All right. God bless you. Stand there, please. You see, somebody came with $1,000 prepared. All right. So, in rents is how much? It's uh $18,000. Let's say it's $18,000 rand. Please, I want you to step out and get this. God bless you. God bless you. Please don't go as you receive this. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anybody else coming? Please step out. Thank you, son. Please step out from where you are. stole on behalf of your business. Give on behalf of your family. Give on behalf of whatever man you want to just do it. Amen. Are you coming? Oh, you have the swipe machine. Those of you who want to do it now, there the swipe machines. You can do that now. Just swipe it. We want to honor those who God have sent to us. Are you hearing me?

And you have a reason for everything. There is nothing you do that is purposeless. And so Lord, these people that you have called out to give this sacrifice to honor the men and the women of God that have come here to be a blessing to us both in preaching and in ministry of songs. Lord, I ask that as their hands are lifted to heaven, may you that see all things and know all things, may you remember these people for what this offering is for. And I pray that every one of them that is standing here that the grace is upon this men and women will begin to find expression and manifestation in these lives. Lord, honor them. Honor them, Father. It's always been your method. You said to Moses, tell the children of Israel that they bring me an offering and that they build me a house that I may dwell among them. that your presence will answer to every challenge, problems, every issues that are in their life. Lord, I ask you Lord, please just help her. I ask you Lord that may the glory of God fill their lives and fill the work of their hands. Father, help them. I am asking you, Father, help them. Oh God, help them. Let no one who has given this sacrifice go unrewarded. Lord, as your servant, I have obeyed you and I ask you, oh God, to do your part in their lives in the name of Jesus. You will never have any reason to weep again. Your morning has come. You have entered your chairos moment in the name of Jesus. Thank you father in Jesus name. Now you are going to go to all the speed points. Go and swipe. If you don't have it in cash you can swipe. You can do transfer. Please put the banking details on the screen. I want you to put the when you give the seed put it there ownership uh ownership guest speaker seed. Okay. As your reference. so that our account department will be able to sort that out. Will you do that? May the Lord bless you. I love you. I love you all. Thank you for obeying God. Thank you for honoring God and honoring his word. God bless you. You may go back to your seat. I truly truly appreciate you. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. All right. Now if you have your tithes your offering let's give to our father remember we get seated when we give offering and then please can we do that in a hurry as you are doing that I will call up the men of god amen all right please settle down go back to your seats thank you where is uh troops where is fortunate or troops where are they Just hand this over to them. Hallelujah. All right. You have your tithes, your offerings. Please bring it out. Let's bless the Lord with our substance quickly. Heavenly Father, we are grateful. Thank you, Lord, for the offerings we are given today. Lord, I thank you, Lord, that if you needed anything, you would not ask any of us. But as a matter of principle in your word, the scripture says, \"He that sweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly. And he that sweth bountifully shall reap bountifully.\" He said, \"Let every man give as he has purposed in his heart, not of necessity nor grudgingly, for God loves a cheerful giver.\" And Lord, we pray that you make all grace abound towards us. that we all having all sufficiency in all things shall abound to every good work. Thank you heavenly father in Jesus' name we pray. And everybody say all right. You can also go and sw...",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ncompound insights\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:[Music] Welcome to Compound Insights, a podcast by CFA Society New York. I'm your host, Rob Rowan. Today we're talking about impact investing, particularly measuring its impact with precision. Arcelon Matafar leads JP Morgan's development finance institution. Its mission is to channel private capital to investments with a developmental impact. And I'm pretty sure from my research it was the first of all US banks to do this. Now Arcelon was right at the middle of this because he worked with the development banks to create uh JP Morgan's DFI methodology. Previously he worked with governments on through McKenzie's economic development practice where he advised countries on their growth strategies. Arcelon got his bachelor's from US UC Berkeley and his mers in international development from Harvard University. So Arcelon, welcome to the podcast. Thank you for having me Rob. So impact investing is challenging to say the least in many respects but you know developing an a methodology for determining impact is hard and can take a long time. So um how do you you and your team uh accomplish the measurement of impact? Well Rob I think impact investing as you mentioned is really hard but it's especially hard to do it in capital markets and wholesale banking. the most of the impact investing you probably see out there is done by private equity firms investing in social enterprises and they, you know, take a board seat. They're much more in touch uh and engage with the management of the company and therefore they're able to probe a bit more. They're able to collect data much more and they're able to kind of steer some of the decisions of the management in order to achieve more impact. But the problem with that is that it can't scale beyond a certain amount, right? private equity uh space is a limited asset class and you know there's billions of dollars that for instance in developing countries are invested through private equity but if you really want to uh address kind of the global challenges that we have you need to be able to mobilize money from the institutional investors that are active in public markets and so that's what we really set up to do with the JP Morgan DFI another thing I'll mention is that when you go into the public markets there was already an existing asset class named ESG as a I wouldn't maybe call it an asset class but at least as an approach to investing uh which is distinct from impact ESG was much more internal facing looking about how investor can reduce exposure to companies that present environmental social and governance risk with the uh way that they typically do their business versus um impact which is searching or companies that produce measurable social and economic and environmental good in society. So it's a much more output and outcome oriented thing. If you look at kind of the assets under management that were looking for impact in public markets, the easiest places they could find them were for climate. Climate impact is much more easy to identify. If you're investing in a renewable energy company, if you're investing in, you know, energy efficiency and, you know, electric vehicles, all of that, it's a little bit easier to kind of find the impact thesis there. And that's why we see a lot of sustainable and impact assets under management in public markets mainly going to developed countries where there are much more larger pipelines of such climate finance type of projects and much less in developing countries. So we thought if we were to measure not just impact but a specific flavor of impact called development impact defined as helping improve the quality of life of people in developing countries, reducing poverty, reducing inequality, providing access to basic human needs, we need to consult with the people who have been doing that for many many years and they happen to be outside of Wall Street and be in the official sector where official development institutions publicly owned you know organizations like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank have been using methodologies for decades on how to measure development impact and learn from them and create an approach to be able to apply it uh to capital markets um that uh are being channeled towards developing countries. Okay. Well, see you made it sound like a little bit less of a daunting task than it probably was. You made it sound really easy. You just go to the development banks and take what they did and then just build on top of the capital markets. That was a half a sentence. How long did this take you? So that took near near a yearong effort. Um because you're absolutely right Rob they are a different beast. I mean the development banks themselves are typically have you know one or two main products. They either lend or they provide um some direct equity investment. We in an investment bank have a long list of products. We uh advise on M&A. We underwrite debt and equity. Uh we syndicate loans. We you know do custody and fund services. We do, you know, derivatives that hedge risk from commodities to FX to interest rates. So there's so many more things that we as a investment bank do. And there's also a different life cycle to a capital markets transaction and a public deal than to you know the kind of private direct engagement uh that a development bank does. But I think we had one thing going for us as an investment bank is that, you know, we typically are the ones that are doing due diligence on an entity before uh we help them raise capital in the public markets. And we could use that capacity to do not only due diligence on the financials of the company as we normally do, but now do do due diligence on the development impact. um and essentially uh adapt and adopt the methodology in a way that uh in that capital markets life cycle can provide that information for the benefit of impact focused investors. And then the other task we do as a U investment bank is then to distribute those assets to institutional investors and essentially market that asset to a range of portfolio managers and uh that that are searching for assets that have both financial returns and positive impact. And there again it required a lot of I think socialization of our methodology to be accepted that a transaction that on the surface you know you know it's not climate finance it's not necessarily something that just has an environmental perspective which was an easy thing to check the check boxes of a uh sustainable or impact investor but then to show that if it's gone through a methodical uh diligence and has a development impact thesis it should also be eligible for a sustainable portfolio and that required many many additional years of time to socialize that with with the uh you know private institutional investor community to get that uh consensus and was there much in the way of well as JP Morgan is a GI and one of the more regulated organizations on the face of the earth not that I'm not talking about airlines or airports but pretty close right was that also a factor in how you built the methodology or was there already enough you you all have lots of methodologies. So, was there already enough work done on that that you could you could get it into there? I think the methodology part was a little bit more a a marriage of doing something that is both you know rigorous and technically correct but also uh practical uh within the time frame and within the situations in which we operate. That was for the methodology. But then when implementing the methodology, Rob, you're absolutely right. Being a highly regulated organization, anything that you're doing that is in any ways new in a bank requires layers of work that you need to do with different functions in risk, compliance, controls, legal, and to build an infrastructure that allows you to do something that is relatively novel for a financial institution. So we went through all that and created, you know, a lot of the rules of the roads and the compliance. And we also showed that that at the same time something that we're doing if you again kind of take the you know a few steps back and you look at it from a little bit further you know holistically um is not that different either from what is our role which is mobilizing capital from you know people that want to invest their savings to people who need it for you know growing their business. It's not that different from a role of, you know, an underwriter and doing the due diligence and presenting the investment opportunity. It's just an additional layer on top of that that adds the development impact assessment and broadens the outreach to impact focused investors. Okay. So, not to talk about all of Arcelon's headaches, but let's talk about one of the other headaches. You mentioned it earlier, scaling. Yes. So, how did you how has that evolved? How did y'all handle that? So first it was a lot of zoom meetings backtoback all day every day um with you know both sides of the equation I think you know as a capital markets intermediary uh you know on one hand our clients are those that want to raise capital these could be both companies as well as sovereigns um you know whether it's local governments or national governments to tell them you know what the process is what it entails in terms of effort and in terms of time and um what the benefits would be and the other side to the investors to share with them you know what the again the methodology and the process is and how that might satisfy certain impact and sustainability criteria they have. So that required a lot of socialization with those two client sets required a lot of internal socialization with our bankers because we are a relatively small team but we cover 80 countries. Right. Right. and most of the world and the way we do that is that you know JP Morgan has offices in you know 80 of the you know uh lower to middle inome countries and so we can cover all of our clients in those geographies through our bankers educating our bankers on when it would be appropriate to pull us into a deal how they can uh pitch our capabilities to their clients you know we can join some of those pitch meetings as well but you know through them. We could help uh socialize this with with a large client set as well as on the investor side with our sales organization which again covers all of the institutional investors across the globe. Here it's mainly in developed markets in the US, Canada, you know, all of the European countries, Nordic countries all the way out to Japan and Australia where there are also pools of capital that are seeking both financial and and and social returns. So those are the providers of capital and the users are in the low inome countries. But after that effort and after doing that for about three years, we launched in January in 2020 and then in April of 2023, we actually convened a industry working group comprised of 10 of the largest investment banks, you know, folks like Bank of America and HSBC and Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank and the Texas and Sockgen. those folks some of the largest institutional investors that invest especially in emerging markets and sustainable investing in emerging markets like Amundi and AXA and Goldman Sachs asset management and bearings and CDPQ. So we brought all these. So we brought some of the development banks again, Asian development bank, the French development agency, the US development agency. We brought in industry associations like uh IKMA as an observer, the uh international sustainability standards board, ISSB as an observer, UN agencies that focus on you know uh international development and we put our methodology again on the table and we said let's think about how can we make it better and how can we make sure that it addresses everyone's best thinking and ultimately everyone's criteria for sustainable investing in the margin markets in a way that we could again scale this up because no matter how much we do it as just JP Morgan and we're the largest bank in the world but we're still less than 10% of you know market share in securities underwriting and sales and so if we want to meet the challenge of global development and the trillions of dollars are needed in order to finance it. We need uh we need other you know people to engage with this uh space and and to in many ways replicate the approach that we had had been doing and uh and and just uh in a few weeks we will be publishing the final version of the guidance that is coming out of this working group that has been working for about a year and a half. So everyone point your web browsers over there. It'll be two weeks when you rough roughly two weeks when you hear this podcast. I guess one of the things that I'm curious about is I would I would guess that for all of those people that you brought together, one of their biggest sticking points is probably due diligence. It's complicated. Yeah. It's a lot of work. It's expensive and then you had a lot of places you don't have a lot of benchmarks, right? Is that fair or were there were there other sticking issues that they had? I think that's true, but I think the problem, you know, I mean, if I kind of double click into that is that there's not a standardized approach for how to do that due diligence. And when you don't have that, even if you do the diligence, but then someone says, \"Okay, that's interesting information, but it wasn't the information I was looking for. I was looking for this set of criteria and do you have any info on that?\" And they're like, \"No.\" And then you go to another investor and they have a different set of criteria. And so a lack of standardization in the industry is the best you know the biggest constraint to scale right and so when we brought this group together and we you know deliberately brought kind of equal representation from the sell side and the buy side was to say that let's agree on a common set of standards of how we measure development impact impact on the sustainable development goals in these kind of public markets so that the buy side agrees that yes if disclosure exists this in this format, following this methodology, following these kind of set of criteria, then yes, we agree that it will be eligible for our sustainable portfolios. And then in many ways the sell side has both the kind of guide book on how to do it but also an incentive now to go through that process and spend that additional time and money and effort that it is because they know that doing so would expand their reach to trade and sell to a broader pool of institutional investors. So that kind of uh collective action problem was in many ways addressed by by bringing these uh groups together. It's fascinating. So that's one of the major issues. Could you talk about from your perspective what the other trends in this let's call it a sub sector are? Yeah. Are the what are the other things that people should be thinking about from an overarching perspective? Yeah. I think from an overarching perspective, another uh thing that we've maybe done that I think maybe changes the paradigm of how the investment should be done is that a lot of people when they were looking for sustainable investing, they were looking for projects. They were looking for one infrastructure project here or one kind of education project there. It's always it was a project based approach to to investing. And I think that's fine. There's definitely projects that should be financed that can be ring fenced can be created as a you know special purpose vehicle and have no recourse to any other kind of balance sheet or sponsor and be self-contained in both the revenues and the financing and you know the ultimate how how the profits are distributed. But it's not enough and people talk about this all the time. there's a lack of projects because there's not enough projects that in emerging markets that have already been completely costed out. Feasibility studies are done, offtake agreements are done, you know, environmental, social studies are done. There's a lot of upstream work that needs to be done for those projects exist. That's one. And second is that even if they do exist, often the projects in developing countries are smaller than the ones in developed countries. And because of that subscale, they'll never have the ticket sizes that are needed for those large institutional investors that manage the trillions of dollars of assets under management. So it was just a fundamental constraint that was kind of clogging up the the pipes for for money to go to places where they're needed. We took that away by saying, well, you know where else there's a lot of opportunity? Just plain old corporate financing. financing the general balance sheet and budget of either governments or corporations that just want to do their business and grow and by growing serve the underserved in their communities. But how do we ensure that then that's different from just conventional financing and we said well okay what if we shift the lens of analyzing a project and you we take it and put it on the overall entity. So we say okay if an entity let's say a company let's say a cell phone company in Tanzania meets a certain standard of impact measurement and management and kind of ahead of time Xanti discloses plans for expanding in a way that is sustainable it's responsible it's inclusive it's meeting the needs of the underserved and ultimately addressing development gaps if they meet a certain threshold of doing so then their full balance sheet their entire corporate financing their mainstream banking should be eligible for sustainable finance. We thought that as a much more scalable solution than creating another labeled instrument and painting it I don't know orange and then saying okay now this is a new asset class for development provide financing to those that have committed to addressing the development challenges in their country through mainstream channels if they meet a certain uh standard of impact measurement and management. Okay. So it's a little bit like where ESG went from an investable product to more like a screen for all products. Right. Right. Okay. And this will now become a screen for all entities. Right. And once that entity is seen to be addressing and advancing the sustainable development goals, then that entity should be eligible for sustainable capital for their equity, for their debt, for their revolving credit facilities, for their trade finance facilities, for their corporate derivatives, for whatever they're doing that ultimately helps them finance their business. and grow whether it's going to OPEX or capex or to a ring fence project or whatever it's going as long as they meet a standard of transparency on their impact then it is sustainable and and should be eligible for civic capital. Again, different investors will have different criteria, and there's going to be some that say, \"No, no, I only want to sell invest projects.\" And that's fine. If that's their mandate, then that's what they should do. But we think this broadens the aperture to bring in more sustainable investment opportunities to market. And what's really interesting, Rob, is that in my conversations with investors, what I hear is that it's the lack of supply that is the constraint. It's not a lack of money. A lot of people think, \"Oh, there's a $4 trillion gap to financing the CGs. There's probably not enough money.\" No, the money actually says that, you know, I have more demand from people who, you know, pension funds and whatnot that want to give me money for sustainable investing in emerging markets than I have places to deploy that money. So, the problem is a lack of supply. We think that this approach will really increase the supply into the market. All right. So, can you at this point, I know this may be impossible, we'll take a crack at it. Can you forecast how much that might close that gap? Yes. So the first order effect we think and this is just by taking the volume of transactions that we at JP Morgan evaluate to have development impact and grossing that up by our market share. We think that this if this approach is adopted by the industry it will bring over $200 billion of additional supply of development impact investment opportunities to the capital markets each year. Oh okay. each year on an annual basis 200 billion and that's the first order effect. We think the second order effect is that if this increase in supply then allows the investors to grow existing funds right now the total amount of assets under management for sustainable investing is about $3.5 trillion and they're telling us it's a supply side constraint that we're not growing that number. So if this additional supply then motivates them to increase the assets under management for sustainable investing then there will be more incentive for the issuers to issue even more sustainable investment uh opportunities and so that could have a you know a virtuous cycle that can grow you from the you know couple hundred billion to you know orders of magnitude. Yeah. And just thinking about that in terms of size at 200 billion it might only be a couple years before you start to address in a meaningful way the scaling problem. Right. So exactly f that's fascinating. So are there other trends that you anticipate? Yes. So what we really see this Rob is is a bit of an ecosystem play right like we are bringing all of the different players into this space to kind of build this ecosystem scale things up. And this ecosystem is going to need some other components as well. for instance, it's going to need market infrastructure. So, currently all of this data on impact and everything, we've been putting it on a PDF on a page and emailing it to investors and whatnot. And you know, there's a limit to the scalability of that approach. So, we uh we're thinking about now building an impact data platform which will digitize this information which will make it much more easier for the investor side to filter and search through. there's an investor sitting in the Netherlands and says, \"I really want to invest in, you know, companies that are advancing food security in West Africa.\" They could just punch it now into this platform and see any companies that have meaningful metrics and targets and accountability and transparency to reporting progress on advancing food security in West Africa. And then they can, you know, go to their, you know, dealer, you know, investment bank and ask, \"Hey, do you have any securities from these type of companies?\" and uh and you know we can either originate and and and sell it to them or you know we might be already in the process of already doing so. So I think that market infrastructure is one trend. I think another one is third party a whole suite of thirdparty services. the end of the day, you know, I think a fundamental cornerstone of what impact requires is trust, right? Like you need to be like, \"Yeah, this is this is really having a positive impact.\" And you know, obviously transparency on the reporting of the person who's getting the money is important, but then you want typically independent verification. You want monitoring and evaluation. You want to know was it that company's specific activities that had a causal effect on those impacts on society that were generated or was it just luck or was it something else? So, you know, you need some more detailed analysis. You need to kind of poke the theory of change that is being claimed that the output of one company is going to lead to certain societal level outcomes. You might get academia involved to test those theories with a variety of research that they do. you're going to need benchmark indices to be created that are have you know impact as a criteria for inclusion in that index methodology so that the asset manager can have a relevant index to benchmark their portfolio against. So you know you're going to have a variety of analytics products and you know things like that. So the there there's a whole kind of suite of third party services that are going to need to be developed around development impact investing in capital markets that again through this effort we are already working on but we think that uh I mean we invite any one of your listeners to to really reach out to us and engage with us uh as we build this out because it's again a it'll take a village right and that's a business idea folks right there that's how CFA New York's podcast delivers you aren this has been fascinating. Thank you so much for the uh the insights. Um there's a lot more to learn here uh for most of the members I'm sure. So uh but you all have done a lot of work here. This is it's really interesting. So congratulations. Thank you so much Rob. Thank you for having me. And and to all your listeners exactly if they want to learn more they can look up impact disclosure guidance uh on the web and I'm sure there'll be more material that they can find to uh uh seek out. Very cool. So, and uh and thank you all for listening to this podcast. Now, before you go, particularly members of CFA Society of New York, we've talked a little bit here about some of the sustainability issues, and many people know that heating and cooling structures are two of the major contributions to carbon production globally. On October 17th, CFA Society of New York will have an event that will dig into some of the new technologies that building owners can use to optimize their HVAC and other functions to be greener and to manage expenses, which is exceptionally important in subsectors like office. So, if you're interested in hearing about those technologies, please register for that event on our website. Until next time, I'm Rob Rowan and this has been Compound Insights.\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ndws azerbaijan*s president aliyev highlights economic progress in un\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:Ladies and gentlemen, for many years I spoke from this tribune about tragedies of aggression, occupation and injustice experienced by Azarbaja. Today I will speak about our long road to victory and peace and a new era in Azarbajan's history about how we managed to end the occupation through a liberation war and how we won peace by political means. For nearly three decades almost 20% of Azarbajan sovereign territory remained under military occupation by Armenia. 1 million of Azarbajanis were expelled from their homes as a result of the policy of ethnic cleansing and war crimes conducted by Armenia. Their fundamental human rights were grossly violated. Four United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted in 1993 demanded immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed forces from the occupied territories. Sadly, these resolutions were never implemented. Armenia demonstratively ignored them because no sanctions were imposed on it by international community. The OC Miz group established in 1992 to facilitate a settlement has failed in its mission. Instead of enforcing the norms and principles of international law, its co-chairs sought to preserve the status quo and keep the conflict frozen. In 2020, after almost 30 years of ineffective negotiations, Azarbajan was forced to exercise its legitimate right to self-defense under article 51 of the UN charter. During the war, Armenia shelled our towns and cities with ballistic missiles and cluster munitions, killing more than a hundred of innocent civilians. Azarbajan in its turn conducted the war in strict compliance with international humanitarian law. We ensured protection of civilians and refrained from targeting non-military infrastructure. In 44-day patriotic war, our armed forces liberated occupied territories and restored Azarbajan's territorial integrity in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The 10 November 2020 marked the capitulation of Armenia and restoration of Azarbajan's territorial integrity after nearly 30 years of occupation. Right after our victorious war, Azarbajan declared its readiness to open a new page in relations with Armenia based on mutual recognition of territorial integrity and sovereignty. We proposed five basic principles rooted in international law. We tabled the proposal for a peace treaty. Then we initiated a negotiation process on its draft text which lasted from October 2022 to summer 2025. Despite several attempts to derail the process, the negotiations produced positive results as they were conducted on a strict bilateral basis free from any kind of external interference. On August 8 this year, the foreign ministers of Azarbajan and Armenia in Washington in the White House in presence of the leaders of the United States Azarbajan and Armenia initial the text of peace agreement. The same day the president of Azarbajan and the prime minister of Armenia signed the joint declaration. President of the United States Donald Trump also signed it as a witness. Moreover, Bbajan and Armenia jointly appealed for the closure of the OC Mins group and related structures as an obsolute mechanism no longer relevant to the peace process. Accordingly, on 1st September, the OC adopted decision to permanently close these structures. Regional connectivity has been at the core of our vision for lasting peace. Another key outcome of the Washington summit is the Trump route for international peace and prosperity trip which will ensure unimpeded access through the Zenazer corridor and foster regional connectivity. The recent Washington summit has also signaled a new phase in Azarban US relationship. Together with President Trump, we signed the memorandum of understanding between the two governments regarding the establishment of a strategic working group to develop a charter on strategic partnership between Azarban and the United States. It opens new horizons for partnership in political, economic, energy, regional connectivity, defense, security and other fields. The waiver by President Trump of the sanctions imposed on Azarbajan in 1992 in the form of the section 907 of the Freedom Support Act is a historic step as well. The permanent removal of section 907 by the US Congress would eliminate a legacy of double standards and help strengthen trust and cooperation at a time when Azarbaijan is contributing to global security and stability. Overall, the agreements reached during my August visit to the United States carry historic significance. I want to express my gratitude to President Donald Trump for opening a new chapter in the US Azarbajan relationship for his decision to elevated to the strategic partnership level and for his support to the peace process between Azarbajan and Armenia. Right after the victory in the patriotic war of 2020, Azarbajan started large-scale reconstruction program in the liberated territories. During the time of occupation, Armenia leveled to the ground hundreds of Azarbajani cities and villages, deliberately ruined 65 mosques. That was a policy of Armenia which was ruled by war criminals for almost 30 years. We are rebuilding villages and cities raised to the ground. Under the great return program, already more than 50,000 people live, work, and study in the liberated territories. One of the gravest humanitarian challenges facing Azarbajan in the postconlict period is a landmine contamination during the time of Armenian occupation. Since November 2020, more than 400 Aarbani civilians and military personnel were killed or seriously injured by landmine explosions. This massive contamination obstructs the safe return of displaced persons and delays reconstruction projects. Similarly, the tragic fate of nearly 4,000 Azarbajanis who went missing during the Armenian aggression and occupation since the early 90s continue to require close attention and action. Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the global challenges we are facing, we believe that response must be inclusive, fair and universal. Through its many initiatives, Azarbajan shown its clear commitment to advancing sustainable solutions. Aarban is proud to have hosted COP 29 last year where we achieved important outcomes in advancing climate action, the green transition and equitable access to financing. As a host of COP 29, we guided negotiations towards ambitious and balanced outcomes, ensuring that all voices, particularly those of the developing world, were heard. The adoption of the new collective quantified goal at COP 29, also known as Baku Finance Goal, is a historic milestone in global climate finance. This commitment brings previous 100 billion US dollar annual climate finance goal to at least 300 billion US dollar per year through 2035 from public sources in developed countries to developing countries. Azarbajan also successfully finalized the long awaited framework for carbon markets under article six of the Paris agreement making the Paris agreement fully operational 9 years after its adoption. Several key agreements were signed at COP 29 to make the loss and damage fund fully operational, providing critical support for vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. Being strongly committed to the green transition, we at the same time should not put unrealistic targets in front of us. The world cannot live without fossil fuels today and in foreseeable future. Energy security is closely linked to peace, regional connectivity and economic development. Azarbajan continues to play a proactive role in advancing these objectives globally. Aarban has established itself as a reliable and indispensable partner in providing energy security to many countries. We play a strategic role connecting the Caspian region with international markets through diversified oil and gas pipeline systems. As of today, we are supplying natural gas to 14 countries. This ranks Azarbajan as the top country in the world in terms of number of countries it supplies with pipeline gas. This reflects our strategic role in enhancing energy security and diversifying supply routes across Europe and beyond. Moreover, Azarbajan and Syria have recently strengthened their bilateral partnership focusing on energy supply, infrastructure development, and postconlict reconstruction. Since August this year, Azarbajan started to supply Syria with natural gas via Turkey, significantly reducing its electricity shortages. Azarbajan also attracts large investments in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. Almost 40% of our energy will be generated by renewables by 2030. Connectivity projects like east, west, and north south corridors cross our country. We have witnessed almost 90% growth in cargo volumes through the middle corridor since 2022. The transit time along the corridor have been significantly reduced. the biggest trade fleet in the Caspian Alat International Trade Port with its annual capacity reaching 25 million tons in the near future. The Bakud Bilisi cars railroad, nine international airports, the biggest air cargo company in the region and many other factors have turned Azarbajan into one of international transport hubs. There is a great potential for cooperation in digital connectivity. Aarbajan leads the digital transformation initiative through such ambitious projects as the digital sukway. This project includes plans for the advanced fiber optic cable network under the Caspian Sea establishing Azarbajan as a key regional digital hub. Azarbajan achieves significant economic growth by focusing on diversifying its economy beyond oil and gas, developing the non-oil sector, and improving the investment climate through reforms and transparency. Reducing poverty and unemployment to the historic low of 5% is another achievement of our country. Recently two major international rating agencies Modis and Fitch have increased Azarbajan's ranking. Azarbajan was provided with favor favorable investment grade status c\r\n",

The federal government has unveiled the official theme for Nigeria's 65th independence anniversary tagged Nigeria at 65 all hands on deck for a greater nation. According to the office of the secretary to the federal government of the federation, the theme underscores the need for unity, collaboration and patriotism across all sectors in nation building. Activities include the Jamaat prayer at Abuja Central Mosque on Friday, September 26, a church service at the Ecumenical Center, Abuja on Sunday, September 28th, and a world press conference to be addressed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akum, on Monday, September 29th. President Bola Tinibu has directed the Bank of Agriculture to clear outstanding aras of 30 billion naira owed to agro dealers and impute suppliers under the national agricultural growth scheme and agro pocket. The order followed the release of funds from the African Development Bank AFDB and aims to strengthen support for farmers and stabilize the food supply chain. The Bank of Agriculture has been designated as the custodium of all agricultural financing program funds and has pledged to pay all compliant beneficiaries within 24 hours using its electronic wallet system. The bank stated that the payment represents the second tranch released by the African Development Bank to set obligations from 24 from 2024 dry season and wet season programs. The managing director of the bank of agriculture, Aayos Shotin, described the move as defining moment for the agricultural sector, adding that it will unlock opportunities for sustainable and profitable agro business. Beneficiaries are required to open a bank of agricultural accounts to access the fund while weekly progress updates will be provided until full completion of payment. Deposits by Nigerian banks with the central bank of Nigeria CBN under the standing deposit facility rose to a record of 3.5 trillion naira on Wednesday rising 38.34% from 2.55 trillion naira the previous day compared to the 348.8 billion naira a year ago. The figure represents a 164% jump. Analysts linked the surge to excess liquidity in the banking system with credit appetite and high lead high lending rate near 40%. The increase came a day after the CBN cuts its benchmark interest rate to 27% narrowed by the policy corridor and reduce commercial banks cash reserve requirements to 45% in a bit to lower borrowing cost and stimulate private sector credit.

After his graduation in 1961, Yun joined the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant and was later appointed lecturer of economics at the Cheetah College. During that time he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side. In 1965 he received a fullbrite scholarship to study in the United States where he obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University graduate program in economic development between 1969 and 1972.

[Music] Akiwanduat Shuinka on July 13, 1934 in Abuta State, Southwest Nigeria stands as one of Africa's most celebrated literary figures and a global icon of resistance against oppression. His life and works reflect an unwavering commitment to justice, culture, and the transformative power of arts. Shuinka was born into a Euroba family in colonial Nigeria, an environment that exposed him to both traditional African culture and western education. His father Samuel Aayod Shuinka was a school headmaster while his mother Grace Enola Shuinka was a devoted Anglican. This blend of indigenous and colonial influences deeply shaped Shuinka's world. Shuinka attended government college Ibadong and later proceeded to the University College Ibadon where he studied English and literature. Shuinka completed his education at the University of Leed in England earning a degree in English and later a doctorate degree. In the late 1950s, Shuinka began working as a dramatist at the Royal Court Theater in London. However, his passion for storytelling and cultural preservation drew him back to Nigeria where he founded two theater groups known as the 1960 mask and the Oris Theater Company. Shuika's works, often the fusion of western dramatic techniques and African themes address universal issues of justice, freedom, and human dignity. His early play titled A Dance of the Forest, which was introduced in 1960, written to celebrate Nigeria's independence, critically examined the nation's socopolitical trajectory, setting the tone for his career as both artist and activist. Shuika's activism became more visible during Nigeria's postindependence years. In 1967, during the Nigerian civil war, he called for a ceasefire between federal forces and Bafran separatist. This led to his arrest by the military government and he spent 22 months in prison where he wrote a short drama titled the man died prison notes a harrowing account of his imprisonment and a profound critic of authoritarianism. Shuanka has authored more than 20 works including plays novels poetry and essays. In 1986, Shuika became the first African to win the Nobel Prize of Literature, an achievement that brought global recognition to African literature. Shika remained an unspoken critic of oppressive regimes, often at great personal risk. His activism extended beyond Nigeria, addressing global issues of injustice and human rights. During periods of military rule in Nigeria, he went into exile, continuing to write and speak against tyranny. Today, Shuika is celebrated not only as a literary giant but also as a symbol of resilience and moral courage. Palm oil has long been a vital component of Nigeria's agricultural heritage with roads tracing back to pre-colonial times. Originally serving local needs, its importance has grown exponentially, propelling Nigeria into a prominent global producer. Spread across regions like Edo, Delta, Cross River, and Uno states, the country boasts extensive plantations and advanced processing capabilit\r\n",

He is also a former managing director of Al Jazzer English. Uh Giles uh climate change is the defining story of our century. Still journalism is quite uh failing to fully engage audiences, create social impact and momentum for political action. What is your take and what is to be done to you know to to go forward? Thank you Jeppy. Um thank you for the invitation from HC Montreal and from Ry. It's wonderful to be here to speak to everybody. Um I'm Cameroon in Indonesia, Egypt or Maldona, Nigeria. Let me start. A free press is fundamental to peace. It is enshrined in the United Nations sustainable development goal number 16 which talks about promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and free press is fundamental to that. Professional journalists can help to facilitate peace by hopefully promoting tolerance. But let's stick to talk about journalism's role in peace with journalists themselves are increasingly under attack. In Gaza, for instance, the toll has been staggering. As of September the 1st, the Committee to Protect Journalists counted 189 journalists killed. Other organizations put the figure even higher, up to 247, according to the United Nations Human Rights Office. Journalism is not only dangerous in war zones like Gaza. It is increasingly just collateral damage. They are being deliberately targeted environmental society left in the dark. So why raise the climate issue in a forum on media and peace? Because climate change is not just an environmental challenge. It is humanity's most pressing long-term challenge. its many cascading impacts, drought, wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, and forced migration undermine stability and can fuel displacement and conflict as indeed Dr. Gregoire has just mentioned. In this way, climate change can drive violence. But the link between climate and conflict also works the other way. War worsens climate change. War devastates environments and ecosystems. It destroys infrastructure. It involves war machines burning massive amounts of fossil fuels. And it leaves the enormous carbon cost of reconstruction. And also war diverts focus pulling attention and resources and political will away from climate action at the very moment the world needs it most. The mission of journalism is to present facts and informed analysis to let people know what is happening in the world. Media journalists inform us about climate change. They inform us about the risks, the challenges, the consequences and indeed the solutions available. It media can help us better understand, better acknowledge and hopefully address the challenges posed by an overheating planet. So in these times, good journalism is in fact an essential climate solution. But is the media doing enough to cover the climate crisis? as indeed you asked Jeppeti. To begin answering that question, let's turn to six key truths and I took these from an article from the Yale program on climate change communication. So, six truths that we can use to start as a foundation as as a baseline for what is accurate and undeniable. The first truth is climate change is real. It's real. Climate change is happening. The second truth, it's us. Human activity is causing climate change. Thirdly, experts agree there is scientific consensus about human-caused climate change. Four, it's bad. Climate change harms people. It harms livelihoods. It it destroys livelihoods. It kills people. Five, others care. Many people, most people are concerned about climate change and support climate action. And sixth, there is hope. Action can be taken to limit the harm if we act now. So why isn't media doing enough? Despite the scale and the nature and the urgency of the climate crisis, my contention is that the media is not doing enough to cover the story. There are notable exceptions, but too often climate coverage is sidelined and demoted down the news agenda or in some cases climate change is not covered at all. So why is that? I will offer two reasons, two possible reasons. First, the fear of activism. The fear that some journalists fear being seen as activists. Some editors. Hello. Could you please put on mooch? Thank you. So, the fear of activism. Some editors worry that covering climate too strongly will look like advocacy rather than journalism. This is false framing. Reporting facts about science, about impacts and solutions is not activism. It is journalism's duty. Truthful reporting is not necessarily neutral. It needs to stand against corruption, against injustice, against disinformation, and against the erosion of truth. Secondly, a second reason why media is not doing enough. What I call the tyranny of immediacy. Newsrooms like audiences are wired to respond to sudden visible threats, war, scandal, disaster, Donald Trump's latest political outbursts. Climate change, by contrast, is often gradual, complex, and harder to capture in a single headline. So, it slips down the news agenda, even though the consequences are existential. Though, let's be clear, for millions of people around the world, climate change is neither abstract nor distant. It is immediate and devastating, destroying lives and livelihoods. There are efforts to address the media's gap in climate reporting and strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. One leading initiative is covering climate now which I um am uh a co-chair on the steering committee. It's a notfor-profit initiative and it's the largest media collaboration of its kind with over 500 partners media partners worldwide. Its mission is simple. To help journalists raise the quality, the reach and the urgency of climate reporting. Let me give an example. Here's something remarkable. In 2024, last year, a global survey published in Nature Climate Change found that 89% of the world's population want their governments to do more to address climate change. So, think about that. Nearly nine out of 10 people across continents, across cultures and political systems. The survey was across the world. So across the world, there's overwhelming agreement that more needs to be done. Yet most of those people don't know that they are in the majority. Instead, they may feel isolated, trapped in a spiral of silence that stifles momentum. and the and the full sense of isolation weakens collective action. If people knew that their views were shared by almost everyone, it could spark broader movements. It could pressure and inspire governments, corporations, industries, and and communities and individuals to accelerate climate solutions. And so earlier this year, Clevering Climate Now media partners across the globe, across the world joined in a joint coverage um around Earth Day earlier this year to report about this theme of the 89% majority. It was called the 89% project. Newsrooms collaborated to highlight the global consensus on climate action. The aim was to break the spiral of silence and remind audiences that they are not alone. This is a journalism as a force for peace and a force for good. Amplifying solutions and shared ground. So let me close with this thought. Journalism can and must do more to cover the climate crisis and journalism can be a voice for peace. But this mission is only possible if journalists themselves are protected, supported and empowered to tell the truth. Because in the end protecting journalists means protecting journalism and without journalism there is no truth, no accountability and no peace. Thank you very much. Um I have a question. How do you you think that new ways of telling the story, new storytelling, new journalistical techniques might help journalists who want to do more for climate uh bridge that gap. You know the their news rooms being wary about running those stories. The journalistical tools to brainstor in general and then individual journalists newsrooms in general. A great way is not just to have an environmental desk or an environmental reporter. Actually, climate is in all stories. Economy, um, national security, uh, in everything there is a climate angle. So, bring your climate in, bring your climate news into every story because there is a climate angle in every story. In terms of individual journalists uh covering climate now we we have a formula of three ways of covering a story. A good way of covering a story. Firstly humanize, localize, solutionize. Let me go through those. Humanize is find the human angle. Find find a person a character who can represent your story. We all we all love stories. storytelling, we we respond well and when we see other other people uh we respond well to stories that that are centered around people. Um localize is that although climate change is this big global issue, find ways to make it local as well. Connect the local to the global. Um and then thirdly, uh solutionize. If there are solutions, report them. That doesn't mean sugarcoat and create false hope but that you know there are many in many cases there are solutions. Um so often as much as it's a doom and gloom and negative story where it is appropriate and I underline where it is appropriate and where there are solutions let's hear about those solutions and let's rigorously analyze them and assess them to make sure they are real solutions. Thank you. Thank you Charles. That's very inspiring for our daily journalism, journalistic work. Now we have a few minutes for question and answers. So the microphone is open to uh the many many uh participants to the session. The floors is yours. Uh please uh madame sari please open your mic and ask your question. then it'll be time for Muhammad from RRI. Okay, thank you so much GCP. Uh I think it's really interesting um attending this webinar. What uh I really want to talk about is yes, I think all of us I agree that um media have a very crucial role in um promoting peace and climate change. But then what we need to think about is about this media. This media is often the main source source of information that the public relies on especially regarding to climate change and peace. Um, how should media organizations produce content on different issues in a way that informs and engage audiences without creating fear, panic or further tension? We know that reporting on climate change can sometimes create climate and fight or maybe hopelessness if it's too and conflict can accidentally inflame decision is framed with bias orism. I think this is um we need to talk about this how can we create any common sense or how we report the climate change and how we cover this sensitive issues without creating fear panic or further tension that's all my questions thank you so much who's that question for study uh I'm for the third for Giles yeah for the for okay thanks Thank you. Okay. Um let me just say I apologies my apologies. After sorry we'll have a question for Muamar. Then we'll have to go to Elen Astrai who's pressed to go. So uh then we'll have a longer Q&A later. So thank you for your patience. Giles please. Thank you for the question. uh uh I I believe as I said actually media is an essential climate solution because we need as as the uh question the the the asker said we need media to inform us of what's happening in the world so that we can really acknowledge the problem and then hopefully address the problem. We can't address the problem without acknowledging the problem and understanding the problem. Now your point about um doom and gloom and we don't want negative and we don't want to make things worse. Uh you're absolutely right. Uh we we don't want to people to lose hope. Um and as I said we we should give solutions where where they are and there are many solutions. There are many solutions but I have to say as a journalist we can't give false hope. So there's there's a balance. We can give solutions but we don't sh like we say we don't sugarcoat. We don't make everything sweet and sugary and nice. We are journalists. We have to tell the truth and be accurate about the situation. And the situation at the moment is not great. We are, you know, as the scientists are telling us, it's it's the world is really needing to address this problem. um many parts of the world are already suffering terribly from this situation. So I completely understand we don't want to just focus completely on the negative. Um we do want to give solutions where there are solutions but at the same time we as journalists we need to be responsible. Um it's and now on to Muamar Abdullah please be patient we'll come to your question after the intervention of Elanatino Who's the third speaker today? Thank you. Just be patient. Muhammad, please. The floor is yours. Hello. Asalam alaikum. Uh can you hear my voice? Yes, we can. Salam. Okay. Thank you. And I would like to ask to Mr. WGO actually uh he said that uh media play the roles in delivering uh the informations to the audiences and since uh he mentions the Africa so I would like to know do local languages or maybe traditional African instruments have impact in delivering the messages to the audience on radio productions because as we know that there are so many local or tribal languages in African region. Thank you very much. Thank you Moar Garv. Yes. Thank you. We have many languages and we broadcast in most of these languages. We don't broadcast in in all the languages. For instance, in we have more than 250 languages. Oh my god. We are the 250. I said languages you cannot broadcast in the 250 languages you spend all the all the time broadcasting on climate change. What we have done is what the the public media has done is to select the most important languages. Uh and the country has been divided in 10 regions and in each region you have two or three languages which are the most important and these languages are are listened by everybody. Everybody can can can hear what we are you are saying and in at the level of the the the Yaund the capital we broadcast in for instance in the case of Camun in French and English but there are areas like in Tanzania where they broadcast in Swain which is a local languages local language in Nigeria they they broadcast in Hosa in Sineagan they broadcast in Walof We we always use uh the local languages for the message because the what is important is that this message should should reach the grasshood. It should reach the people on the field because they are the one facing climate change. They were they are the one who has to take some measures to face climate change. So we use local languages but we cannot use all the local languages. we select the most important uh of them. I don't know if I have answer your question. Thank you Gregoire. Yes, that was a good question and uh Mr. Wano and thank you Mr. Solenas. Thank you. Thank you all. Now let's go to Elena Strainoli. Elena is a journalist from Ry Television. She works for a very very interesting indepth program that is called Presa. Um she specializes in repotage and often it's about crisis areas. But before we hand the floor to her, I would like to show her show you a trailer from her documentary that won the Global Peace Media Awards in 2024. Thank you for your attention. It's a minute and 50 seconds. [Music] [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] for cheese. for [Music] [Applause] [Music] someone So this was the trailer. Uh peace at all costs is the name of the program and it is about reconciliation. You cannot stop war with more war. That was the story and the example that Sierra Leon is giving to the world like South Africa has done in the past like other countries have been doing. So let's hear from Elena Strainoli. Elena, what was your experience shooting that documentary there especially when it came to peace building after conflict? Okay. Uh good morning and good evening everyone and thank you thank you Joseeppe for introducing me and thank you all for the invitation. Erh, I want to start from the beginning. Uh, in September 2022, uh, we were thinking about the new the episode of the new series of of our pro program called Preseta. Uh, the war in Ukraine broke out in February and uh, nobody was talking about peace. So while while we was thinking about how to address this topic, Ricardo Yakona, the host of the program told me to read a book called in Italian mechanics of peace. Uh we were looking for a proactive way to talk about the war. In the beautiful book I mentioned earlier, we found the history of Sierra Leon, a small country on the west coast of Africa which had a 20 year war that left thousand and thousand dead and wounded. A bloody and violent war. Uh after the end of this war, there were two paths to take. continue to the hatred or try to build a new state based on peace on peace at all costs. So we decided to tell the story of all these absolutely ordinary people who day after day in their communities decided to build peace. director Mateo Debo and I traveled from Freetown, the capital of the state, to the most remote inland villages, meeting dozen of people who work every day to defend the peace uh that has been built with hard work and dedication. It was a very very strong experience from an emotional and people who dedicate their life their lives to building peace. From these people I learned that peace is not a definitive goal uh but must be defended and protected every single day. Uh we met people as I said from remote villages who learned to forgive each other. uh because the war in Sierra Leon was really terrible. It was a civil war which pitted friends, brothers, parents and children against against each other. So they needed to rebuild trust, find a way to get people to talk and achieve forgiveness. I've been in villages where there had been dozen of murders, violence of all kinds and betrayals. Yet thanks to the work of a local NGO called Fambble Talk, these people managed to rebuild their social fabric, the social network. No, the for example, we met a woman in a small village. She told us that she had been raped by her neighbor's son whom she had known since he was a child. He had been forced to join the rebels and commit terrible acts as you can see at the small uh footage. You know the trailer. Yeah, the trailer. So in order to return to live together in the same village, they were forced to look each other in the eye and confront each other. They told, cried, argued of course, but in the end he apologized and she accept this apologize and every day he goes to fetch her water for example and take care of her little garden. He takes care of her a form of reparation for the harmy coaster. I met also Italian priest who built a school for poor children in the remote villages teaching them every day to listen each other and to talk each other. Uh this priest were already in Sierra Leon during the war. They were kidnapped and some fled into the jungle to escape death. But they all stayed. No one none of them returned to Italy. Uh no, don't worry. Please, the technical personnel, could you please re re go back to Elena? Uh we are having Joseph Abal on the screen. Joseph, please mute your microphone. Thank you. Little technical bleach. No problem. No worry. No worries. Go ahead. Go ahead, Elena. Thank you. So, uh I was talking about the Italian price. No. Um they stay they were kidnapped as I was saying and some fled into the jungle to escape that. But all of them stayed in Sierra Leon. No, none of them returned to Italy. They wanting to be there for to help the people they knew to rebuild the school destroyed by the rebels and to bring their words and works for peace. We went to the hospital of the NGO emergency. I think that everybody know knows emergency. The hospital is in Freetown is for poor people. They were sincerely on during the war and had to treat people who had had for example they had their hands sorry cut off or who had suffered gunshot uh once and all kinds of violence. They told us that it was very difficult but they too stayed for the local population. We would have lost everything without them. And so looking at these examples, I thought that peace and caring for others are very closely linked. And memory, of course, memory, I think, is everything. The memory of war and devastation must always be cultivated. In Freetown, there is the peace museum where photos of the victims are displayed, where the violence described and remembered, where photos of the militia leaders who committed war crimes are displayed. But above all, the museum reconstructs the long peace process that allowed Sierra Leon to come to terms with its past. Every year, hundred of children visit the museum to keep the memory alive. saw that what happened in the past will never happen again. At at the end of this journey in Sierra Leon, I understood that peace is very fragile and must be defended. It cannot be in it cannot be taken from granted for granted. And I believe that this lesson is useful for for everyone, especially for us Europeans who have lived in peace for 18 years and take it for granted, of course. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows up that nothing lasts forever and that we must defend what we have. I've been asked if I consider myself a peace journalist. I don't know really. I am a journalist and I believe our job consists not only in talking about wars, catastrophes and negative things but also and perhaps above all in talking about and describing the good things, the solution to problems. I believe that world is full of good people. people who build peace in their own small way. We as journalists we must give them a voice otherwise we risk being overwhelmed by by mistrust and cynism. Thank you Elena. Oh sorry sorry no I have a question for you. You said that peace is nurtured by memory and caring for others and it is built every day. Your program is also very active in the on the climate front. You do investigations very frequently. Do you think that also climate change awareness and fighting climate crisis is built every day by people and journalists? Yes, of course. Of course. I think that um our role as journalist is uh to shine uh a light on those who speak of peace, of climate change, of people who do something for change things around us. At preset we always try to report things in a different way. Even when we talk about issues for example such the environment, health, work and gender issues for example, we always try to take a human and constructive approach [Music] focus on human beings with their demands, needs and specific characteristics. I believe that we must keep people at the the center of our narrative along with rights we have won and the society we have built. Uh because I I think that the the risk of a return to totalitarianism is very serious. And I think that as journalists we are under attack. Yes. Every day we live in Italy. Italy as I think as people know we have drunk mafia a lot of colleague died for reporting because they write around about these issues for example about drugs no and I think that we need uh we we we have to try to search the truth and fight for the truth because I think that truth is the only tool for peace and uh for for defend our democracy. Thank you. Thank you, Elena. Elena mentioned Andrangeta and mafia. That's the organized crime in Italy, mostly dealing in drugs, but also doing business. And Elena is courageously reporting on drug uh on on drugs in the south of Italy. Thank you for your contribution. Thank you and sorry because I can't stay with you uh for the entire duration of the meeting today. I'm sorry. Very sorry. Thank you very much for your contribution. That was great. Thank you. Byebye. Okay. Bye-bye. And now it is time for question and answers. We have a few hands uh raised. Please keep them. We have a queue here. Abdullah Aljanath from Ararai was waiting from for has been waiting for a few minutes. Abdullah, please uh the floor is yours. Please unmute your your microphone. Can you hear me, sir? Yes, we can hear you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Sir, what is your question? Also say who it is for. Okay, sir. Greetings from Bangladesh, sir. I'm I'm an engineering journalist from Bangladesh. uh in I am now my question is from the point of view of journalism and social conflict in my society we believe all men are created equal and true equally mean on the basis of the character a man should be judges so on the point of uh true equality how can uh journalism uh contributed in our society this question and my another question is uh in shund bone is the largest mangro bone on the earth who which also save us from various catastrophic catastrophic cyclone and any other problems. So he a lot of foreign save the sunund bone which is the largest mangro bone on the earth. So how can we get and collaboration to save the uh I have a question on the on this global platform. Thank you sir. Thank you. Uh it is from your uh uh Jer I'm asking Mr. Gile. Okay. For Giles. Okay. Question sir. Yes. Yes. Yes. The question is for Giles also. Now the floor is open to the other speakers. So if Kuar or Javad would like to intervene as well when we when questions are posed please do. Giles. Well, basically Asia is faced with so much uh stress from climate crisis and how to fight that please. Yeah, thank you Abdullah. I'm sorry the sound was was not very very good so I didn't catch everything you said but in terms if you were talking about the stress of being a journalism and and mental health. I think it's a really important topic that we need to address and that is um mental health uh not just of journal I I was a journalist in in war zones and I had uh post traumatic stress syndrome PTSD and that that was many years ago that was from being in a war zone but now um you have many journalists who are facing the stress without being on the front line they are face Even in the newsroom they are they are seeing footage unedited footage of war of climate disasters and I think we have to be aware of the mental health of journalists and the psychological stress that journalists face. Of course um you can um we train journalists we provide um support psychological support in whatever way counseling counseling support many media have to do this but many media don't and so I think the the mental health of journalists is really important um to take to take care of because it is increasing and there was a a recent study a recent global study showing that the cycle psychological stress of journalists is is increasing because of the dangers, the risk, because of the terrible things they are seeing. So, it's a really important topic. Thank you, Giles. Uh note to all participants, if you you will be able to find on the chat a message from Muhammad Kabal from Rarai. He had some suggestions uh on top of what Charles has already explained. Uh now more questions from uh Dion Utami from RRI. Please Dian, the floor is yours. All right. Uh thank you very much. Um I'm Dian from RRI Palo and here I'm going to ask for um Mr. Giles. So uh in recent conflicts uh there are so many examples of uh the journalists uh in social conflicts. We have seen uh in so many media outlets accused of bias and journalists being targeted under disputed claims. In our role as journalists or media stakeholders in global peace dialogues, how can we insist on neutrality and protect in independent reporting and ensure that legal and ethical safeguards actually work even in um even under political pressure. So uh what do you think about that? Thank you. Thank you Deian. very very very important question and um as I said journalism journalists are under increasing attack um we've seen recently in Gaza some terrible situations some of my old colleagues uh who were killed um deliberately targeted not just killed by accident or by crossfire they were deliberately killed they were targeted uh there are there are what what can be done. So there are firstly we have to work with organizations who are protecting who who are um providing information about journalists. For example, the committee to protect journalists, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, all of these are uh tracking and monitoring and logging the the killings of journalists and that's very important. We have to and the United Nations UNESCO are doing the same. We have to put pressure on governments to act so that there is no impunity because um a lot of a lot of um either states uh governments, states or non-state actors are getting away and with murder by killing journalists and so there's no accountability. So we need to demand accountability. Another very important thing is media organizations need to stand in solidarity with each other. When a journalist is killed from one media organization, we need other media organizations to stand up and support and be standing in solidarity. Unfortunately, um, recently in Gaza, we saw some journalists killed and there was some, um, disinformation that they were terrorists or that they were supporting terrorism and these these these claims need to be checked. What was happening is some media organizations were were just paring the claims without verifying, without checking. Um, so they were they were they were repeating the propaganda of of the party that had killed the journalists. As journalists, we need to verify and so we need to stand in in solidarity with each other. Uh, I think that's that's so important. Um, and it's it's it's getting increasingly more important that media organizations show solidarity because one journalist killed somewhere is an attack on all journalists. Thank you. I hope that so thank you for that question. It's really important. Thank you. Thank you. Can I add something? Yes, please go ahead. Yes. I believe that uh there are two aspect of these questions. first of all what we have to do as journalists and secondly what the others can do to protect us. We journalists first of all we should uh refuse to involve ourself in this uh how can can I say editorial lines which are brought by governments by people and so on and groups we have to remain professional we have an ethics we don't have to involve ourself in things that will bring us out of our our ethics and a journalist had that's for me the best way of protecting ourself. The second aspect I don't believe in the uh with what is happening in Gaza and so on. I don't believe in the capacities of organization of journalists to protect journalists. I don't believe more again to those things. What my point of view is that the government and the organization like United Nation should involve themsel should commit themsel in the protecting journalist because this is one of the the right the right of human being the right of human being we the the the freedom of expression and so on and this organization are the only one who and protect us. But when government uh are they the themselves involved in bad practices where the the the United Nation is becoming weak and weak weak and weaker journalists are like if they are under a rain the big rain without a protection is that's the situation and now we are talking about all those things because they are happening in areas like Gaza and so on. But I would like to tell uh to everybody here in Africa we have been facing this this type of thing since where journalists are killed nobody will do anything journalists are arrested nobody will do anything they are in prison nobody will do anything. So we have as our organization as as journalists to call for the protection of government and the United Nation and we ourself we have to avoid all what is bias. We have to to stay h strongly on our ethics of journalists and remain professionals. Those are the two aspect of my my my answer. Gregoire, we have a question on the on the chat of this uh meeting. It's from Mahadevi from Ararai,...",

That is the principle that is the clarion call that is going to drive all of us and that shapes the nature and character of everything else that all members and structures of Africa may be involved in. So whenever people come with challenges of water, of collapsed infrastructure, of education, of unemployment, what we think as Africa may movement is what we do now. We do not plan that no don't worry those things they take time to resolve. So the idea and thinking that must drive all of us is what do we do? M. So it's total freedom and emancipation. M that is the clarion call that that drives all of us as to what do we do even on areas where we cannot do anything but we must have solutions now. There's no tomorrow. Everything else that has to be done is total freedom and emancipation. Now that is the clarion call of Africa my bu movement and that is why in the introduction of the restoration manifesto there is a quote by Amla Cabral who says that always bear in mind that the people are not fighting for ideas for the things in anyone's head. They are fighting to win material benefits, to live better and in peace, to see their lives go forward, to guarantee the future of their children now. So that is the clarion call that then deals with where we come from. Now the first part of the restoration manifesto emphasizes what we have just emphasized now which is to say that this document is the restoration manifesto. It is the founding document which gives political ideological and organizational compass of Africa may be movement. So a compass is a navigator. So compasses were used before the electronic navigators were there to say that this is the direction that you take. So the compass, the navigator of Africa may be movement is this restoration manifesto which calls for total freedom and emancipation now. for inch. total fra and emanip. No. And then the last part if I read you won't believe that I'm saying the correct thing because it's in the because it's in the language is the koi language and it emphasizes that this restoration manifesto is the product of the people. It is the resounding acre of collective wisdom forged in the trenches of shared struggle. A tapestry woven from the threads of cuminal dreams and unyielding resolve born not from isolated egos but from the pulsating heart of the masses who refuse to bow to tyranny. It shuns the vanity of selfabsorbed elites. those or ivory towers dwellers detached from the blood, death and sweat of real lives and instead arises as the unfiltered voice of the oppressed. The blueprint carved by hands hardened from labor and hearts scared by injustice. demanding that Africa is restored to her true guardians. So that is the essence of the introduction. So comrades, we're going to talk to what is highlighted in each and every section of the restoration manifesto so that all of us we have an understanding. Then the next section that starts on page five deals with the question of where do we come from as a people and paints a correct picture that before the arrival of colonial settlers. We were not sleeping on top of trees and under the rocks as the indigenous people of South Africa. We had order. We had organized systems in the pre-colonial history. There is proper evidence that we were even involved in the extraction of mineral resources and also involved in global trade as well. And we have to emphasize this point because if you go to all the bookstores now majority of the books that tell the history of South Africa, they start in the year 1652 when Jean Fanic and the colonial settlers arrived in South Africa. So majority of history books that exist about the history of South Africa is not the history of South Africa. It is the history of white people in South Africa. So all the historicization of the history in South Africa is the history of white people in South Africa. So we are retelling it to say that before the arrival of colonial settlers, we had systems, we had governance systems, we knew authority, we were involved in subsistence farming, were able to generate food and we could distinguish between wild and domestic animals. That is the reality which you must and we must never ever believe that we only got to know civilization with the arrival of white colonial settlers. We were a people with order with systems before the arrival of colonial settlers. And of course the colonial settlers came. The first tried in the year 1510. So the first attempt to colonize South Africa began in the year 1510 in what got to be known as the battle of the the the Salt River battle. And the first attempt to colonize to occupy this part we call South Africa today was done by the Portuguese by because they were the dominant force in the world. So in their global trade from Europe with the Asias, they used to pass through the Cape and use the Cape as a stop station and then proceed to engage in different trade with the Asias. Then there was an attempt by a Portuguese colonial settler called Francisco de Alia who tried to colonize South Africa but he was defeated in a physical war by those that he tried to take the land of. So the first attempt to colonize South Africa did not start in 1652. It began in the year 1510. So you will see that the Portuguese ultimately succeeded in the colonization of Angola of Mozambi because when they were traveling on the coastal lines, they will always try to take over those land parcels. They tried to take South Africa but they didn't succeed because our forefathers resisted that colonial invasion. And then of course in 1652 there was a colonial settlement which began as a stop station of a company called VOC like the Dutch East Indian company which had the full support of the Netherland government uh an army to colonize our country and when the colonial settlers took our land there was resistance. Those who were had the land fought back to say you can't take our land. You can't take our animals. But they were defeated because the colonial settlers had superior armaments. They had superior weapons. They had guns. dead bombs and ourselves were fighting with the spear. That is why in the logos of almost all liberation forces in South Africa, there's a spear as a symbol of resistance against colonial settlement. all together comrades I don't want to the so that is we were so there were many battles in the war against colonial invasion so you know in a war you have different battles that take in place in different areas and in different time periods There were many battles. Some were worn by our forefathers but very few. But the war of colonial invasion, the war to resist colonial invasion. We did not win that war. Our forefathers did not win that war. Those who tried to fight through organized political parties from the early 1900s up to this day, we have still not won the war. We are still a conquered and defeated people by colonial settlers. And how do we know that we are still a conquered and defeated people? We see that because of the landlessness. The land still belongs to the descendants, the grandchildren, the great grandchildren of the colonial settlers and invaders. Majority of animals are owned and controlled by the descendants of colonial invaders. Almost all our precious and industrial mineral resources and metals are owned and totally controlled by the colonial invaders. We are still slaves in our own land. We are still suppliers of cheap and easily disposable labor to the colonial settlers and their descendants. So we're still a conquered people. So that is what the history part of the restoration manifesto deals with and of course gives recognition of those that fought against colonial invasion, those that fought physically. Those that resisted, those that surrendered their bodies were defeated. Those that tried to form political formations to resist colonialism also did not win. And we make mention of the fact that part of the reasons why the colonial settlers defeated us is because they never there was never a period where they fought us as a combined force. I would I are together comrades. So there was never a time where we were fighting against colonialism as small separated clans and kingdoms. There was never an African or South African army which said let's resist these people. They fought us separately and then they were able to subjugate us and defeat all of us. And the defeat is still a reality. We are still a conquered people. Erh we can we can we can say it whichever way but materially was still under colonial rule. Even the manner in which the economy was designed still serves the colonial interest. So if you check the railways the infrastructure not only of South Africa of the entire African continent all the rail projects move from the areas that have got mineral resources to the ocean to supply the colonial settlers and the colonial masters. There is no real projects that interconnect all of us so that we can interact amongst ourselves. So the colonial economy is still a lived reality and we explain that those they have they fought with spears and at some stage after the arrival of the first colonial settlers from the Dutch then the British came in then they annexed the whole of South Africa. And in the late 1800s, the Dutch settlers and the British settlers fought amongst themselves. They fought within themselves like they had something we called they called the Anglo Bua war. But it was not just Anglo and Bua warriors. There were a lot of black people who were co-opted on both sides who were sent as mercenaries to fight the Anglo Bua war. There are so many black people who died in the Anglo Bua war fighting the war which has nothing to do with them. And in the year 1902 when the Anglo and the Bers settled they resolved the war. They said let us form a white only government and exclude these blacks. And then they started to write the laws of that country and then they agreed amongst themselves that this new entity which they going to call the union of South Africa is going to be under British colonial protection. all together comrades. So that that they say that yes physically there were lots of casualties from the booers and the Dutch seem to be not interested in supporting the booers. So let's agree that let's form a white only government which is going to be under British colonial supervision. That is why the law that established South Africa in the borders that it has now was passed in the year 1909 as the Union of South Africa act by the British Parliament in England. And then they were merging the two Bua republics which was Transval and the Orange River Colony with the two British colonies which was the Cape and the Natal to form what is called South Africa today. And that was a white only government that excluded black people from participation from meaningful participation. And the understanding was that this union of South Africa is a colonial project of the British Empire. So the head of state of South Africa from 1910 when it was launched was the king of England. And those that were doing administrative works It's a I saw. is a pill. Now, thank you very much. It was a necessary break comrace that we had to take. was still explaining the fact that South Africa was established by an act of parliament passed in the British Parliament as the Union of South Africa act. That act is still you can search for it in the internet. The Union of South Africa act which established South Africa India. Now there's interesting things that happened before the passing of the union of South Africa act that when the booers and the English were fighting amongst themselves they had a national convention like a national conference of men only 33 men to say how do we resolve this question and then they state. Let us form, let us merge these four provinces into one country called the Union of South Africa. The head of state will be the British Empire. Whoever is a king or queen, they will be the head of state of the union of South Africa. And then the others will be prime ministers. And then because there were four provinces, they then said they can't have one capital city, they must instead have three capital cities and then the other province will be prioritized in terms of the infrastructure which it needed to be prioritized that time. As a result of that colonial settlement, the Transval was given the administrative capital city in Ptoria. So it's a colonial agreement that Ptoria became the capital city of South Africa administratively and then the legislative capital of South Africa became Cape Town on behalf of the Cape Colony and then Bloom Fontaine became the judicious capital on behalf of the Orange River Colony and then the Natal was given a project which they had to finish as part of the priority programs that were being engaged in at that time. So the fact that 1994 did not change that colonial agreement, it's confirmation that was still a colonial project because it's senseless to have three capital cities. It's politically and administratively burdensome to have legislators at the far end of South Africa and then you say you have got a democrats which must involve everyone in terms of participation. It's impossible now if there's public submissions that have to be made in parliament for many parts of South Africa to get to the Cape. But if there was logic, a capital city ideally should be at the center of the country so that everyone else is able to come there. But we are living under a colonial agreement of the Anglo Bua arrangement. So the reason why the capital city and the head of state operates from the union buildings the union that is the union of South Africa as in the union of South Africa act. So we we we are still in that. Then we narrate the history of resistance against the union of South Africa. The first attempt of course was these traditional leaders and the black middle class which said let us found one organization to resist the colonial union of South Africa. So before the 1912 January 8 formation of the South African natives national congress there were congresses in other parts of South Africa in the orange river colony there was an organization of the free state congress led by mika in In the Transval there was a congress led by Sifako Mahad. In the Natal there was a congress led by John Langalle Dub. Then they started negotiations to then found the South African Natives National Congress in Bloom Fontaine because Bloom Fontaine is central. So Bloom Fontaine is the most central city in South Africa. So logically wherever was coming from whichever part of this South Africa they then met in Bloom Fundine to found the South African Natives National Congress on the 8th of January 1912 which was renamed the African National Congress in 1923. Two important things to highlight about the formation of the South African Natives National Congress. It did not have fundamental objections to the Union of South Africa act. It actually did not. So the ANC formation did not object to the Union of South Africa and including the fact that it was going to be under British rule. They were fighting for inclusion of some of the black people within the Union of South Africa. And this is not fiction. It's things that you can read in their foundational documents. They honored and respected the British royalty. Even when they sent delegations to England to ask for inclusion into the union of South Africa, they will say we are under your leadership, oh king. We worship you. I'm I'm fine. So the at for atformation atformation. So So you must go and retrieve the contents of the ANC petitions to the British royalty. They were saying no just accommodate the educated black middle class and those that have got proper don't include everyone but some of us who are we we speak like you sound like you maybe the has achieved what it was founded for because it was never about the total liberation of everyone. Of course, with time the nature and form of the struggle changed. So we then give so comrades we explained that in the part of the history section that the struggle for our freedom and emancipation is like a relay race. So you know a relay race is what those young men from Botswana did in Japan in the world championship. So the first one runs and hands over the button to the next one. Then they take the button to go to give to the other one and then the last one runs towards the finish line. the in the struggle for freedom. We take it like that that we are not the originators of the struggle for total freedom and emancipation. We taking the buttons from those that fought with spears and were defeated. We're taking the buttons from those that formed political parties. We are taking the bur from the generation of freedom in our lifetime. Now comrades since formation the ANC was conservative and was always by the way even their conferences were opened by representatives of the colonial government that no we hear you about the Christ we have we are aware that you went to Britain there are some rules that were going to we wish you well in your conference but you must tell us what are your resolutions that is what used to happen but then the turning point in the struggle methods began with the generation that defined itself as the freedom in our lifetime generation of Robert Mangalis of Maji of Nelson Mandela Oliva of Walter Cisul that generation said that this method of fighting in respect and in fear of the colonial government must come to an end. Let's engage in confrontational battle of defiance first. Let's defy the colonial laws. Let's adopt a perspective that is going to articulate our vision and aims as to what type of society do we want to build in uh South Africa. That is why on the 26th of June 1955 the freedom charter was adopted which said that South Africa belongs to all who live vinid black and white and which also said that no government can claim authority over the people unless it is unless if it is based on the will of all the people. That was a radical departure. So you know and it also said that the mineral wealth beneath the soil the banks and monopoly industries shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole. And in that time that was too radical to say are you saying that we must all vote that is too radical. That is why the uh that is why the the freedom charter was banned and everyone else who associated with the freedom charter was considered to be to be a terrorist. So to to have a copy of the freedom charter was you are a terrorist automatically. To associate with the aims and objectives of the freedom chart meant terrorism. And because of the freedom charter, everyone who associated with the freedom charter were arrested in what became known as the treason trial. So it was tasinous to associate with the freedom chart. Are we still together comrades? And then the freedom charter led to the burning of all the liberation forces and then it led to the formation of the army. is with the army that is as an armed resistance against against the apartheid. So we're explaining this relay race of who fought and what happened. But an interesting development as well which the historicization or the history books even of the ANC conveniently suppresses is the role that was played by the Panaffricanist Congress of Azania and Robert Mangaliso Subukqu because after the adoption of the freedom charter there is a ction of the freedom in our lifetime generation that said we cannot associate with this thing that says South Africa belongs to all who live in it black and white. South Africa belongs to us black people only. That is what the panafricanist component said. And then they founded the panafricanist congress of Aania in Souto in 1959. And in 1960 then they led the anti-pass defiance campaign which was in Sharpville and in other parts of South Africa. A lot of people were killed because of that struggle that was singlehandedly inspired and led by Robert Mangalisu and that changed the course of history in South Africa. that changed the course of history in South Africa. It led to the burning of political parties. It led to the formation of the army. And when all the liberation forces were suppressed, the voices that rose came from the black consciousness movement with the formation of the South African students organization in 1968. human. The uh so when there was a vacuum of liberation politics in South Africa when the parties were banned, leaders exiled imprisoned. There rose a young revolutionary called Steven Banu Bo to found the South African student organization. And from campuses, the black consciousness movement got to influence the whole of society in the struggle against aparate and colonialism. Almost everyone who joined politics and participated in politics from 1968 in the early '7s almost all of them were organized under the black consciousness movement. So that includes mutant includ all of those people who joined during that period. will later on to join the but they were first organized under the black consciousness movement. The black consciousness movement founded an organization called the black people's conversion in Marisburg in 1972 and elected a president Winfred Hui from Tabanch. Wow. Wow. From Tabanch Winfred Hu. Actually, when we spoke about Winfred Huare, the founding president, president of uh Dr. News, when we spoke about Winfred Huari, the first president of BPC, one of the family members reached out to say is the first time they hear someone speak about the first president of the BPC publicly. And that conference of the BPC then designated Steven Banu Bo as the lifetime honorary president of the BPC. But the most important thing that took place there was the adoption of black community programs. So the BPC says yes we are a political party who are fighting against aparate but what do we do now then they adopted black community programs on health care on the economy on creation of jobs now on education so if you go to King Williamtown there's still a Zanmpilo clinic which was founded by the BCP programs, the black community programs which were under the black consciousness movement and of course the black consciousness movement inspired the June 16 uprising in Suto to resist the imposition of Africans as the medium of instruction. action the June 16 uprising which was condemned by the ANC by the way. So the official statement of the ANC after the June 16 uprising was that these kids are reckless. Why do they want to protest like that? They are reckless. But June 16, 1976 got to organize a lot of young people all over South Africa and it got the apartate ruling class to reconsider aparate as a method of capitalist exploitation. June 16, 1976 got the ruling class to reconsider aparate as an instrument of capitalist exploitation and amassing of resources. That is why after June 16, the Openheimras and the Roberts constituted an organization called the Airban Foundation which was beginning to discuss how do we involve black people in future South Africa. So if you check who were the employees and the people who associated with the air foundation, they include the tanto tanto the first beneficiary of be tanto montan but they also Alo included the current president of the ANC. So the urban foundation of the openheimers and the rupetss are the ones who funded the current president of the ANC to buy a house and to buy a car that time in the 1970s. It's it's a it's in books which he has signed. So when kids were being harassed by apartheid, he was applying for loans from the Openheimers and the and the Ruperts and Hope not being with them in terms of what got to happen. And we know comrades that the escalation of mass protest and everything has led to cordasa which was the conversion for a democratic South Africa to negotiate the transition. But in the part of the history in the section which we're talking to here in the restoration manifesto we acknowledge the role that was played by the workers. We acknowledge the role that was played by women in the antipass campaign in 1956. to acknowledge the role that was played by the churches that as part of the colonial project was an attempt to make black people see God through white people or through whiteness. But you had forces that said we can't associate with that. And that of course was illustrated by the formation of the Nazareth Baptist Church in 1910, the formation of the Zion Christian Church in 1924. But earlier there were Ethiopian churches that were founded by Mangana Mukon in 1892. The formation of the International Pentecost Holiness Church in 1962. The formation of the Bantu Methodist Church in 1933 which got to organize majority of the people because colonialism included the fact that people must see God through white people or through whiteness. And there was resistance from amongst our people. And then of course I did explain 1976 escalated negotiations and then the white capitalist system approached the ANC in exile to say if we were to give you government what are you going to do with it? And the ANC says no we're going to continue with whatever was happening there. Then they said on that condition we will give you government. Actually in the year 1987 one of the senior idols of the openheimers clam Santa said that at the end of the day negotiations should work rhetoric must be dropped and business must continue as usual. That is how the ANC went to Cordesa. Even when FW DLC released Nelson Mandela in the speech in 1990 and other political party and other political prisoners and also unburning of other political parties. He said in his speech that we are going to negotiate on the foundation that capitalism is going to continue, free enterprise will continue unabated, unchallenged in the contents of the speech. So the manner in which this transition happened was on conditions and foundation laid by the oppressors. That is why we have not worn our freedom totally. we went to negotiate a a battle that did not belong to us. So that is basically what the and then of course cordessa happened. What cordessa did was to compromise the liberation ideals of total freedom. They said, \"We're going to take political power, but we'll leave economic power in your hands.\" Even that political power, we don't want all of it. We just want part of the political power. Otherwise, yourselves, you must continue to work with us here so that you can teach us how to run government. The sunset losses meant exactly that that the ANC was babysitted by the aparted government from 1994 when it took government onwards and once they realized that this baby has grown according to the shape that we wanted they said you can go ahead and do it by yourselves because you're doing it correctly. That is basically what happened with the the transition of South Africa. But in Cordesa as well, something that is not mentioned is that the ANC's approach to traditional and royal leadership was that it must be either destroyed or subjugated to civilian nonhered rule. That was the approach of the NC because the the characterization of traditional leaders in allc documents was that traditional leaders are collaborators of aparate. That is why when they came with municipal systems and structures act they redemicated South Africa differently. So you find villages that are cut into half some one one part of the village belongs to this municipality and the other one belongs to the other municipality. One part of the village belongs to this word, the other one, the other word and then the words are given three four village. The word counselors with utmost power over counselors and then traditional leadership institutions turned into tokens. It was not a mistake. It was a decision. So it was a decision that as that is why even government planning when they deal with IDP it's word based not village based and you find in a in a word there is five villages then they go to one village and then they say what do you want there they're fine we have covered what two and have not spoken to other that is why villages are still trapped in a perennial and persistent levels of underdevelopment and and destruction of the basic infrastructure that existed before because that is what got to happen. And of course 1996 the ANC passed a policy called growth and employment and redistribution strategy called gear which privatized state-owned companies and gave more and more economic power to white people. and and since the ALC took power in 1994 this way you can see that nothing was done in an excellent and impressive way. The education system is not perfect. The health care system is nowhere close to adequate. Joblessness is worse than what it was under a partate. The few industries that used to exist in the rural areas, all of them have closed down. Public infrastructure is not maintained. the municipalities or the so-called municipalities that they have created are all dysfunctional and that is what brings us to the next section of the restoration manifesto the diagnosis of what is the problem with South Africa and these come from the observations that came from the people now comrades we highlight that there is 100 issues that are identified there. So the section asked a question why Africa Maya movement exists as a political party and movement and then it says the diagnosis of the problems and it says that the primary reason and purpose why Africa Mayua movement exists is because a substantial number of the people of South Africa in post 27 said it should exist as a movement to address the multiple crisis confronting society. So that is the primary reason. Then there's 100 reasons. We say that even if it was one of those reasons, there was basis and foundation to could form an alternate movement and the reasons start by the fact that our people are still landless. Just land only can form the reason why you should constitute a different movement. Landlessness, joblessness, highest inequality in the world. White people are getting richer. The colonial settlers are getting richer and our people are getting poorer. access to natural resources. We make a point that why is it that the extraction of mineral resources is reserved to multinational large companies only? Why are we not allowing artisal and smallcale mining in South Africa and in a safe environment where we say that for this piece of land you can extract chrome, you can extract gold and have a livelihood out of it. An example is given. Do you know in there was a case that they were were dealing with of a member of the community who was arrested for taking a wheelbarrow of coal in a malathing coal will long trains and wagons take our coal to the ocean every Tons, thousands of tons, millions of tons are taken every day. But our people are not given access to the basic resources which are supposed to define our riches. The levels of crime, gender based violence, education system, healthcare infrastructure, food insecurity, undermining of royal and traditional leadership, marginalization and mistreatment of people with disabilities, super exploitation of workers, a national debt which is not manageable. that government continues to borrow money which they are unable to pay back and that will be a burden to future generations. 100 reasons on why we have to found a different movement. The NC was given 30 years to become an alternative and it's not. It's worsening the problems of our people and an objective political assessment and analysis that we have made all of us is that in the space where the ANC has failed. Who else is supposed to come with durable solutions? We have got two larger ...",

The strong rely not only on power, but on strategy and resilience. Every battle for existence leaves its mark on this land. And only those who adapt earn the right to continue the story of life. The African savannah burns under the harsh Sunday. From afar, a roar shatters the silence echoing across the parched grasslands. It is not just a sound. It is a challenge. A battle for dominance is about to unfold. In the world of the lion, power is never given. It must be taken earned with razor sharp claws and a fatal bite. Young males exiled from their prides roam the harsh land awaiting their chance. They form coalitions targeting powerful prides ruled by aging alpha males. When the moment comes, the savannah trembles, roars thunder through the air as the battle erupts. Claws tear, fangs strike, and the thick manes offer little protection against the fury of the challengers. In this brutal world, only the strongest survive. Only the victors have the right to shape the future. Lions can be ungainainely in the trees. But on the ground, they not only steal kills, they seek to eliminate other predators. Even the much smaller African wild dog is seen as a rival. And in the lion's world, all competition must be destroyed. Wild dogs will normally do everything they can to steer clear of the great cat's path. But should a lion catch their scent, it goes on the offensive hunting with a single purpose annihilation. Silently the lioness approaches and then she strikes. In the chaos, the ever watchful pack has left its pups undefended. By the time the adults return, four of the young are dead. She has no intention of eating them. The lioness leaves the bodies a cold warning to stay out of her path. This behavior seems brutal, but with fewer wild dogs, there is more food for the future of the lion's pride. Scientists even have a name for this leonine strategy of threat and intimidation. They call it the landscape of fear. And it extends over all other great predators that have the arrogance to cross a lion's path. As the first rays of sun touch the floor of the Ingorangoro crater, a majestic landscape is revealed. The perfect stage for mortal confrontations. Around the wetlands of the Goring Swamp, herds of African buffalo move in silence, gathering in tight formations for mutual protection. Yet from deep within the dense tall grasses, a pair of sharp eyes is watching. It is the lion. It observes its prey with a calculated calm, ever ready to launch into the hunt with agility and resolve. But no attack is easy. A powerful charge from an adult buffalo could seriously injure a lion. However, this is not just a confrontation between two species. In the sky, a Rupel's Griffin vulture circles, waiting for the moment to clean the remnants of the battle. On the ground, hyenas fertively prowl, seeking a chance to steal the prize from the one called the king of the plains. The Ingorongoro Crater is not only a masterpiece of nature but also an unforgiving battlefield for survival. Here every creature from the most powerful to the most discreet contributes to the magical balance wisely ordained by creation. Located in northern Tanzania, the Angorangoro conservation area spreads like a living canvas of wildlife covering over 3,100 square miles. It is a unique wonder of the planet recognized by UNESCO as a world heritage site for its incredible fusion of ecological and cultural values. The name Ingorongoro originates from the crater itself, a colossal geological structure that symbolizes the deep link between time, ancient geological layers and the unceasing flow of life. Every rock stratum, every stream, every mountain range here tells the story of how nature has formed, transformed and endured through the ages. The Ingorongoro crater lies in the heart of northern Tanzania, a majestic remnant from the passage of ancient time. 2 to 3 million years ago, a colossal volcano stood here, its height rivaling the world's tallest peaks. until a decisive moment when the volcano erupted violently, releasing an immense volume of lava and collapsing in on itself. The hollow core could not bear the weight of the summit, causing the entire structure to fall, creating a vast depression. This caldera with a floor of 100 square miles and a depth of 2,000 ft is what we know today as the Enorangoro crater, the largest intact volcanic caldera in the world. Not only surrounded by majestic mountain ranges, the Enorongoro conservation area is also a true paradise of biodiversity. Every element from rivers and wetlands to grasslands and woodlands is interwoven forming a complex yet resilient ecosystem. Today, this area remains one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. Here, over 25,000 large mammals are part of an eternal cycle of life. Each species plays an essential role in this complex yet harmoniously balanced ecosystem. creating a picture where every detail has meaning. The endless grasslands stretch out like a living tapestry where thousands of herbivores gather, bringing vitality to a constantly moving landscape. The velvety green grass not only feeds the large animals but is also a refuge for insects and tiny creatures. These small inhabitants perform vital functions the soil decomposing organic matter and supporting the natural cycle of regeneration. The Ingorangoro Crater with its rolling green plains is a stage where wildlife unfolds like a neverending drama. The Eningorongo crater with its vast space and unique ecosystem is one of the most exceptional habitats for the lion. Known as the king of the savannah, a symbol of power and authority, the lion has evolved over millions of years to occupy the highest position in the food chain of grassland ecosystems. However, in the enclosed environment of the Enorangoro Crater, the lion's story takes on a different hue where geographical isolation and constant survival pressure create unique challenges and opportunities. The lion originated about 2 million years ago initially in Africa and once expanded into Asia, Europe, and even the Americas. Today their range is almost exclusively confined to subsaharan Africa and the Enorongoro crater hosts one of the most stable remaining populations. The caldera with its 100 square miles and surrounded by steep walls over 2,000 ft high forms a self-contained ecosystem where lions are relatively protected from external threats. The lions living in the Enorangoro crater are noted for their large size and extraordinary strength. Adult males weigh from 330 to 550 lb with a body length of about 5 1/2 to 8 ft. Meanwhile, females are lighter and more agile, weighing from 265 to 400 lb. The lion's body is perfectly designed for hunting powerful muscles, strong jaws with sharp teeth, and incredibly effective claws. Their pale tory coat acts as natural camouflage allowing them to blend into the savannah environment. The male's mane is one of the species most striking and iconic features. Thick and dark, the mane not only symbolizes strength but also indicates reproductive fitness. Lions with darker manes often have higher testosterone levels, making them more attractive to females during the mating season. Additionally, the man serves as a natural coat of armor in battles over territory or for the protection of the pride. here. The lion excels with its superior strength and lightning fast attacks. Although typically living in a pride structure, lions do not always hunt in groups. When hunting alone, they tend to select smaller or less defensible prey, such as small antelope species. With a speed that can reach up to 50 mph over short distances and the ability to leap up to 36 ft, a lion can close the distance to its prey in just a few seconds. A small unit of lionesses, often two to four, will lead the hunt. Once close enough, one lioness suddenly bursts forward, causing panic and forcing the herd to scatter. The other lionesses quickly close in from different angles, isolating an individual from the herd. This strategy requires not only individual strength but also precision and synchrony among the members. is not always victorious. Their hunting success rate is only about 30%, especially when facing powerful prey like the African buffalo. In this enclosed caldera, the buffalo not only plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, but also stands as a symbol of life, unity, and collective defense. The large herds move slowly under the gentle sun, creating a seemingly peaceful scene that belies a constant readiness against any threat. The African buffalo has evolved over millions of years to become one of the continent's most powerful and adaptable herbivores. Today they are widely distributed in subsaharan Africa from vast grasslands to dense wetlands in the ingorangoro crater. Buffalo find an ideal habitat, lush green plains, abundant water sources, and a relatively low level of external threat within the caldera. Herds of African buffalo often congregate near rivers like the Mongi and Oloyuki or around the wetlands of the Goring swamp. The buffalo population in the Angorangoro crater remains stable at about 4,000 individuals, forming one of the highest densities of buffalo in Africa. The buffalo possesses a powerful physique perfectly adapted to the harsh conditions of nature. An adult individual can weigh between 1,100 and 2,200 lb, reaching a length of up to 11 ft. Their curved horns, which can be up to 5 ft long, are not just a symbol of strength, but also an effective defensive tool. A thick coat and well-developed musculature help the buffalo withstand harsh climates and enhance its defense against lion attacks. African buffalo tend to live in large herds, forming a cohesive network that allows them to protect one another from predatory threats. Each herd typically numbers from 50 to 500 individuals maintaining a stable and wellorganized social structure. Buffalo usually move at dawn\r\n",

And when we first began Oh, are So if we have been discussing brieing contributions and someone raises the hand or goes to the microphone and says Mr. Chairman I call a question. When you say you call a question what you mean you are telling chairman it is enough now can we vote and the chairman will listen to you in favor that is not yours that is for the chairman those ones now I'm using here in favor you will hear him saying those who are in support of the motion that's what it means the chairman will always say those in favor you have heard the chairmans the way they were just saying here then you can say who is those opposed opposed means those who do not support that motion then there's another language that we use here those who support can you say I can you say nay that's just a language to say yes we are in support when you say I you are saying we in support when you say nay then you are saying we no we are not supporting the motion then you will hear the chairman Now say carried. When he says carried, he is not going to lift anything or a back. He's only saying the motion has been supported by the majority. Then he says carried. You cannot say carried yourself. Even if you know it has been carried, don't shout it. That is reserved for who? For the chairman. Henry is the only way. Even if you are so happy that it has gone and you can see clear it is the majority you don't say carried the chairman only will say carried he will say carried then some motion some motions uh need simple majority while others need a two majority or even more for them to be said carried the chairman will determine when a motion has now been supported well according to the constitution provisions. Especially if you say if he says those in favor say I I those in oppos say nay nay and he feels maybe he cannot judge that whether the eyes or nays as the majority then he can choose another option of voting but usually he is allowed to determine from the eyes and ns to judge and declare whether it is carried and if it is not current he can say defeated. defeated is to say the motion has not been supported by the majority of the members. Has not been supported by the majority of the members. When you hear chair is not this chair. You can say chair just alone or chairman. That's a short way of saying when you say chair you are saying an individual who is chairing the meeting. So anytime you say chair that's what it means. and floor the floor here is in the process now of all under discussion the one in the floor is saying that those you hear of those languages Mr. Chairman, I would request because it is at length and we included even the general conference uh rules of wonder which were were begun in 1985 and I want to believe the members have read all this.

Remember that this is a church of God and we need to approach spiritual things with prayer. And I know the Lord is going to take charge of this meeting and we are going to go back home rejoicing. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Uh Pastor Juma uh we are sorry that we have assigned you here. We assigned you before you were chosen. uh because this this was supposed to take place on the 31st of uh uh August and before that time and we had prepared even the booklet and it went that way we still have that honor and you know east Kenya still mean east Nairobi I've not released you fully until the end of today thank you sir you may be seated uh Dr. Joel Okindo is the assistant, the president in charge of ministerial and other assignments in the division. You may greet us. Hallelujah. Amen. We are glad to be home. I'm so honored, Mr. Chairman, for the privilege you extended to me to be part of this important meeting. My prayer is that God's presence will be with us and we will behave and act as a conference should. There is a way we are anticipated to be mature and may that maturity be be be felt and experienced in the way we run these meetings. It will go a long way to bring hon and glory to God's name. Thank you. Uh may I invite the and officers please come here. We are inviting you here so that you are live and they can see the one talking um Jackson Mr. Jackson CPA Jackson Olango is the under treasurer of East Central Africa division. In the arrangement of the general conference, there's the treasurer, there's the under treasurer, then there are associate treasurers and assistant treasurers. So his position is next uh to that of the treasurer who I will introduce shortly. And Jackson Olango is uh the associate not the under treasurer of East Central Africa Division. Please Jackson. Good morning. I'm happy to be home. uh for EXCOM members. I think we have interacted a number of times and um we are thankful to God for the face of community that we can see this morning and we expect that this face of community will give glory to God by the time this meeting is over. We do not just want us to appear to be a community that is struggling to hold but a real community sorry a real community that is actually holding to the glory of God. So we have a lot of hopes that when all is said and done all of us will leave here thanking God that we have seen the hand of God and may God bless you. Amen. And uh Mr. Lango was uh the liars officer. You know the division assigns uh officers to oversee in financial matters and before up to the time he was appointed under treasurer he was the lion officer and the treasurer will give us who is now our new lion officer but we'd want to have him still Mr. Treasurer that he becomes a lion officer. He did very well and we are very grateful about it. Please you may be seated. Uh Dr. Um Ellie Alicia Ogal is the executive secretary. Ah not executive secretary and secretary and secretary. is the same same level as that of the under treasurer and secretary. You know, I keep confusing because there was a time when he was the sec executive secretary under me. So, it is still in my mind. Uh but he's uh uh he holds a very important role at the division. is under secretary and that is next to the secretary that I will introduce later Dom Tom Ela. Uh please greet us. The Lord is good and all the time. The Lord is good and that's his nature. We thank him for bringing us together. We thank him for his church and for calling us to belong to this church. the church is his and we pray that we always act with circumspection without realization. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now I am moving to the uh next level. I will uh bring one by one. Uh let me begin with the pastor Johannes Holana. Uh please come here. Pastor Jiannes Holana is the treasurer East Central Africa Division. Please have it have the the mic. Um, Pastor Wana is uh our treasurer uh East Central Africa Division that uh covers all the countries of the division and he's here with us today. We are very grateful to welcome him. Please pastor Johannes Solana, CFO, East Central Africa Division, greet us and uh give us some wisdom. Good morning to all. Morning. May the Lord guide us and bless us as we do his business today. Amen. now is the executive secretary uh of the division. In those serious meetings in the corporate world, we call him the general secretary or the corporate secretary. And uh he's the man of God, Dr. Moses Maka. and Moses Maka is with us. And uh to appreciate the diversity as we said when we were praying I would just repeat that uh uh Jackson Dr. Tom uh uh pastor Chuma Dr. Ukindo all come from this country. Uh pastor comes from the great country of Ethiopia. Those of you who did some history and they were not allergic to history, you know it was the only country that was never conquered and uh it is the only country that has connections and you can find it in the Bible. Uh it comes from that great country. Now the one about to address you and he will be the one to address you because uh the president uh has all the prerogatives to address meetings but there is always something that the adventist have crafted they call him it is the president or his design. So after having introduced him he will be the design of the president to talk to us about uh matters spiritual. So after I finish I will bring the uh the the president he has already told me he has designated to him uh then he would make remarks after that and then we shall be ready to continue with the meeting. Dr. Maka comes from the great country of Uganda. The great country of Uganda. Please Dr. Maka, greet us before you take the bodium. You will sit and then we'll invite you. The Lord is good and all the time. The Lord bless you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Um now now um the chief of the hill we call him the chief of the hill because ECD is built on a hill and is the chief of the hill. every place, all these fields and conferences that span from Sudan all the way to um Rwanda, Burundi and then Tanzania, then Somalia and all these countries and fields and mean unions and union missions and attached fields. secretary. They are under the supervision of the man of God. If we begin to introduce him, we shall begin introducing him from the time the cows go to grace and the come cows come back from graci and that is none other than Dr. Brascius Ruguri. Uh please uh you may come here. Um Dr. Guri, a man of God, a servant of God who has taken this church for many, many years from one level to another from an insignificant and non division that was struggling from 203. And everybody was wondering whether this baby they gave birth to will ever survive and now it has come to the level where everybody is talking about it. For those of us who go to the the those international meetings Dr. is here. Now we say there are two terms they use that East Central Africa Division is the largest division membership wise in the entire world and not by a small difference by a big difference by a big difference. uh 203 it was insignificant. Nobody was talking about it. But now everybody is talking about it. Things are happening here. People are flowing here with all the initiatives that come from this place that has sparred the growth and movement of the church to that level. I'm talking about Dr. Prasia Sugguri. Now when we started we were being helped by by the general conference by every penny including salaries because we didn't have the money we were just we had come from EAD we were struggling there was no asset distribution so we we depended everything but now they use another term which started about 3 years ago I don't know whether three years ago pastor Johannes or two years ago that now ECD is called a net giver. Net giver means we don't receive the money. We now give the money to other mission fields in the world and that is a place under the man of God Dr. Precious Guri and he has worked in all levels of this church and in most of these he has worked as a church pastor as a school headmaster as a department director from the conference field then union then division and now he's here and as he stands here he's not only the president of east central Africa division is also the um vice president to the general conference. He's one of the 13 uh vice presidents plus the general vice presidents. Pastor Ruguri, we are very grateful as East Kenya Union Conference to host you and to have you. We are very grateful that you found time and you are here and he has assured me he's going to be here until he's told to go. Please greet us and uh but don't make the remarks now. The remarks will come later. Hey, that's right. But thank you very much u chairman for the privilege. Like many have said, it is really a privilege to be part of a convocation like this one. You may not realize it, but this is a very, very special setting made in the bo...",

Please let us be on our feet as we pray. Let's be on our feet. Psalm 104:33 says, I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. I want you to lift up your voice. If you know that you are a living being, if you know that you are alive today, lift up your voice with a grateful heart and begin to sing a new song unto God. Begin to appreciate him. Magnify his name. Exalt him. Somebody is not talking. Somebody is not saying anything. Let God hear your voice. Worship him. Appreciate him. Exalt him. Thank him. Thank him for giving you the opportunity to be alive today. Thank him for the gift of life. It is by his mercy that we are alive. It is by his mercy. It is not by our work. Let us lift up our voices and begin to thank God for his mercies over our lives. I want us to thank God for his faithfulness, for his goodness. The Bible says that his compassion fail not. They are new every morning. Great is his faithfulness. Lift up your voice and begin to appreciate God. For great is his faithfulness over you, over your life, over your family, over your business, over every aspect of your life. Say, \"Thank you, Lord, for protection. Thank you, Lord, for preservation. Thank you, God, because I can call upon you. Thank you for every time I call upon you, you answer me.\" Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Say, Lord, thank you for bringing me here this morning. Thank you for making it possible for me to connect here this morning. Say, \"Lord, I thank you. I appreciate you.

You are going to give me a new story to tell. Say, Lord, I thank you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your faithfulness. Thank you for your kindness over my life. Blessed be the name of God. In Jesus mighty name, we have given thanks.\" 2 Kings chapter 8 verse 6 the word of God says and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was ours and all the fruit of the field since the day that she left the land even until now I want you to lift up your voice say oh Lord my God I can hear you say oh Lord my God use the service of today to restore my life. Lift up your voice and begin to pray. Lift up your voice. Whatever. What is that thing that you want God to restore in your life?

In every area that I've been denied one thing or the other, Lord, use the service today to restore me. Use it for my restoration. Use it for my restoration. Oh Lord, the restoration of my health, restoration of my platform, restoration of my business, restoration of my children, of every aspect of the life of your children. Every area of your life that you are desiring testimony that you are desiring restoration in what area have you experienced loss? Say, Lord, in the name of Jesus, today use this service to restore me. Use this service to restore me. I have come before you the king of king. The woman went before the king. Say Lord I have come before you the king of king in this service. Lord use this service to restore me. Speak through your servant. Oh God give a decree through your servant. Give a command through your servant that my life will hear that the situation of my life will hear. They will listen. they will obey and it will turn to testimony for me in the mighty name of Jesus. As you have prayed, so shall it be in the mighty name of Jesus. Today, your life shall be restored in the name of Jesus. And as so, I want us to put our hands together for God as we welcome the living voices. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just lift those hands and bless Jesus this beautiful morning. He's worthy. He's worthy. You've got time and seasons in your hand. You called for light out of darkness. You don't need a man to be the God you are. For you have chosen to call me Lord. You've got time seasons in your name. And you caught for light out of darkness. You don't need a man to be the God you are in your mercy. You call us. You say you are God from beginning to the bless. You are God by yourself. Say you are God from the seed. Oh, that's no place. Oh, you are God by yourself. You are. Oh, I say you are God. Oh yes. You are by yourself.

Let's go before him and start worshiping him. Give yourself, give your heart, give your soul. Let there be any other thing in your mind now except God. Be mindful of God. Worship him. Tell him you love him. Worship him. Oh yes. Be on your face. Be on your feet. Be on your knees. Be on your seat. Anyhow, worship God. Be free. Worship God. Adore him. Magnify his name. He is worthy. He is lofty. He is gracious. He's alive. He's walking. He's powerful. He's ageless. He's timeless. Lord, we worship you. We give you all the glory. We give you all the honor.

Pour out your heart. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you Lord for your children, for your family, for your job, for your business, for your school, for your education, for the success you seek. Thank you father in Jesus name we worship. You have given him praise. He will raise you. He will bless you. There is always a miracle at the other side of praise. Now that you are praising, enter your miracle. Enter your blessing. Enter your greatness. This body you use in worshiping God will not know sickness. This voice you use in praising God will never go down. These eyes you lifted will never go blind. What God has not yet done, he will soon do. Today's encounter will take you to a new level in Jesus name. It is time to now confess what we want to possess. That's our progression on prayer mountain. We come into his gate with thanksgiving in our heart. We enter into his court with praise. Then we worship him individually just pouring out your heart. When we get before God here, we act like babies. Our age, our education, our cars, our houses, are they really ours? He's the one that gave them to us. We use everything to worship. Then we confess his word into our lives. These are spiritual steps. These are keys. We call what we want to see. Don't allow situations and circumstances to force themselves on you. You are the one that must be the master over situations. How do you do that? You confess it. Call your things what God calls it, not what your enemy want it to be. Are you listening? Yes, sir. Everything we come here to do to land, take it with you home. Operate your life like that. It will end in distinction. Don't tell your body, I am sick. No, that you have pain does not mean you are sick. The enemy wants to put it there. You reject it. Don't say I am poor. I am common masses. No. Those who said that in the wilderness they say we are like grasshoppers. God said moan them down if that is what they want. Joshua and Caleb that said we are able. Then he gave them ability. You are able. You are rich. You are healthy. You are fruitful. You are anointed. Amen. You are a giant. You will fulfill purpose. You will get there. You will add value. You will leave legacy. You will have a great family. How you should be saying to your life every day. Stretch out your hand to receive. Close your eyes to avoid distraction. Say with me wherever you are now, this is my day. This is my d\r\n",

Let me give you just three figures. Since Paris, renewable energy has increased by 140%. Investment in clean energy has increased by almost 80%. And carbon pricing in countries has doubled from 40 to 80. So the clean transition is moving on. And let me assure you, Europe will stay the course on our climate ambition. Our emissions are down nearly 40% since 1990. They now represent only 6% of global emissions. We are on track to reach our 2030 target, that is to cut emissions by minus 55%. And I'm happy to announce that last week member states agreed that our national determined contribution would range between 66% and 72%. So work is advancing and we will formally submit our NDC ahead of COP 30. But in parallel we are also looking ahead. We're working on a 2040 target of a proposed 90% emission reduction. That is our way to climate neutrality by 2050. And my message is that the world can count on European Union's continued climate leadership. My second point, we're doubling down on global partnerships because the question is no longer if the transition will occur and how fast, but who will benefit. Europe's answer is clear. All countries worldwide should reap the benefits, especially the most vulnerables. And that is why we will remain the world's largest providers of climate finance. In addition, we will mobilize up to 300 billion euros to support the clean transition worldwide through our global gateway investment program. And we will turn our collective agreement to triple renewable energy by 2030 into a reality. We support, for example, over 300 million people in Africa to give them access to electricity and clean cooking. And this is not only a climate issue. This is about basic human dignity because no mother, no child should die because simply cooking dinner under abhorrent circumstances. Ladies and gentlemen, President Luna will soon welcome us to the Amazon, the green lungs of our planet. There could be no better place to reaffirm our strong commitment to multilateralism. So, let's get it done. Thank you very much. I thank the president of the European Commission and welcome now his excellency Ray Tarip Erdogan, President of the Republic of Turkey. Distinguished heads of state and government, Mr. Secretary General, I greet you all with most heartfelt feelings. I wish Brazil success as it prepares to host the 30th climate conference in November. The climate law which we adopted last July uh was a significant step for us towards reaching our 253 net zero emissions target. Our endeavors to establish an emissions trading system, implement a green finance strategy, and to create a national green taxonomy are all ongoing. We have built our climate policy on seven pillars. Energy, industry, buildings, transportation, waste, agriculture and forestry. We have also formulated our second nationally determined contribution to cover all sectors and all greenhouse gases through the policies to be implemented in the economy. We aim to achieve an emission reduction of 466 million tons by 2035 and to lower our emissions down to 643 million tons. While increasing the share of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, we are expanding lowcarbon technologies in industry. As of this year, we have raised the share of renewable energy within the total installed capacity up to more than 60%. 205 three I'm sorry we are rapidly reinforcing our infrastructure particularly electrical electric vehicle production and we are prioritizing railway investments in line with our 203 net zero emissions target we will continue to transform our key sectors now access to international financing and cooperation in the field of technology. Both of these are essential to be able to achieve these goals. I would like to underline particularly that our water efficiency campaign and the zero waste initiative led under the opices of my spouse Emina Arduan and elevated to the global level. Both of these play a critical role in our fight against climate change. And we hope to crown all these efforts by hosting the 31st COP conference of the parties in 2026. So with these thoughts in mind, I wish this climate summit to yield beneficial results and I once again extend my greetings to you all with kind regards. I thank the president of the Republic of Turkey and now ask his excellency Anthony Albanese, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, come to the podium. Well, thank you very much, Secretary General. Colleagues, this is the decisive decade for acting on the environmental challenge of climate change, but also seizing the economic opportunities of clean energy. We all grasp the scale and the urgency of our task. We all understand the consequences of inaction for our environment, for our economies, for our people's way of life, and for our children's future. Australians know the toll taken by extreme weather events becoming more frequent and more intense. the devastation that cyclones, floods, bushfires, and drought inflict on our communities. And Australia knows that we are not alone. We are all involved. An essential message that each of us can send to our citizens is this. It is not too late. If we act now and move with common purpose, then we can do more than just guard against the very worst. we can protect our environment and build a stronger and fairer economy for the next generation. That is the optimism and determination that Australia brings to this task. And today I present Australia's next nationally determined contribution. Australia's 2035 target is to reduce emissions by 62 to 70% on 2005 levels. This target is ambitious but importantly it is also achievable. It is backed by the independent scientific advice of our climate change authority. It will mean that over the next decade we have our current level of emissions and it will ensure that Australia honors our commitment to the Paris Agreement and its goal of keeping global temperatures below dangerous levels. Setting targets and showing ambition matters. It provides accountability for government and certainty for private sector investment. What is most important is having the practical plan to reach our goal. And that is where Australian clean energy is the key. Just as our traditional resources have helped to power the extraordinary economic transformation of our region, our renewables can underpin new prosperity for the growing economies of the Indo-Pacific. And our Pacific family is partnering with Australia in our bid to host COP 31 in next year. We want to bring the world with us on climate change. Not by asking any nation to forego the jobs or security that its people deserve, but by working with every nation to seize and share those opportunities. None of us can succeed alone, but together we cannot fail. I thank you. I thank the prime minister of Australia and now ask his excellency Serenel S. Whips Jr. President of the Republic of Palao to come to the floor. President Lula, Secretary General, Excellencies, colleagues, distinguished guest, it is my distinct honor to speak to you on behalf of the 39 members of the Alliance of Small Island States, whose people are the most vulnerable, living daily with the stark reality of climate change, rising seas, stronger storms, and changing ecosystems. are not projections for us. They are our lived experience and they threaten our very survival. This summit is a key milestone on the road to COP 30, a COP at which the outcome must be nothing less than transformational. It must deliver new commitments that keep us firmly on the pathway to limit warming to 1.5. The science is unequivocal. This is a critical decade. Delay is defeat. Every fraction of a degree beyond 1.5 brings irreversible loss, especially for the vulnerable people of small islands. We come here with firm expectations that new climate commitments in the form of of 1.5 aligned nationally determined contributions would be submitted in time to be included in the synthesis report ahead of COP 30. And I must speak plainly to major emitters. Your leadership will define the outcome. Those with the greatest responsibility and the greatest capacity to act must do far more. Align your economies with 1.5. Phase out fossil fuels and exhilarate the transition to clean energy. and ensure that your actions inspire confidence, not doubt in the multilateral process. The recent opinion from the ICJ has reaffirmed that what OOS has long said, climate action is not optional. It is an obligation grounded in international law and in the principles of equity and justice. The world must look to this opinion as a moral and legal compass underscoring that failure to act is failure to meet international duty. Excellencies, the measure of leadership at this summ\r\n",

So let's go into the details of all of this to see why this is unrealistic, unfair, and even politically confusing. Let's see. My name is Toi. Welcome to my channel. Please like this video. Give it a thumbs up as you're watching so YouTube can recommend it to more people and kindly share it as well. To all my returning subscribers, you guys are amazing. You're welcome back to today's video. If you're yet to subscribe, please click on the subscribe button right now. Thank you. So, here it goes. Reform UK has announced it would abolish the rights of migrants to qualify for permanent settlement in the UK after 5 years if the party wins the next election. Under the plans, migrants would need to reapply for new visas with tougher rules. And Reform would abolish indefinite leave to remain, which gives people rights and access to benefits. Reform has also said it plans to bar anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare. If you're saying that people are going to keep renewing visas for every few years, what kind of visas are they going to be on? Are they going to continue being on that visa on the Skoda visa or would you create a new visa? Maybe call it a temporary permanent visa or something like what visa are people going to now be on that they would have to be renewing every 5 years and will you tie them down to one particular employer? What is the plan? Are they going to keep renewing the visas forever, you know, or would they have to like what exactly is the plan? Because sometimes I feel like these people don't really think things true just for political sake. They just come out to say some things without thoroughly because all these plans they are laid down plans that have been put in place to make sure that all of these things are happening you know like or all of these things come to pass right like somebody comes on a skilled worker visa and then after 5 years you get your ILR and then after that you get in to remain they have plans all those phases. So when you now want to scrap all of that, will you now put new things in place and how are you going to make that happen? And also what about the money that people have already paid for indefinitely leave to remain? If you're going to abolish that and take that away, it means you have to give people back their money. So is it also in your plan to refund every single person that have paid for ILR all the money that they spent? people already have in mind that after 5 years they will get ILR and these are the things they need to do to qualify. You write the exams, you write your life in UK test, you apply for ILR is over £3,000 now for one person. Okay, so imagine a family of three or four that have paid for everybody and they are all on their indefinit right now and then you now come out or at that time and then you now come out to say oh no sorry we're taking it back. You're going to take it back. Okay. Yes. Are you still going to give them back the money that they spent? And even if you give them back the money, what you now expect us family people to do? What do you want want them to do? Because it's possible that at that point maybe their visas would have expired, their visas. Okay. It's possible that a lot of things like they've already planned their lives and future knowing that they already have definitely live to remain. So if you're going to take that away from them, what kind of visas are you going to put such people on? and on that visa you going to create new restrictions or new rules and regulations for such visas because you say you're going to create tighter rules you know new visa with tighter rules and everything how is that even going to be possible you know and this even bring me to my next point you know most times when we talk about migrants in the UK they think it's only blacks and Asians that are migrants no we have Americans Australians Canadians right people from these people are also here on indefinite leave to remain Right. So if you're going to that means it's going to affect everybody. Even those from Hong Kong, we all watched the last last debates. We all saw it. But those that watched the ILR petition debates, right? You saw how Hong Kong people were highly represented. That's to show you that they have numbers and people that are well represented. So if you're going to take out ILR or abolish take back ILR from everybody that you've given to given ILR at that point that you want to do that form has also said it plans to bar anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare we don't even assess welfare normally so so under the current system migrants can apply for independ to remain after 5 years given the right to leave study and work in the UK permanently but it is a key route to getting British citizenship and allows people to claim benefits. He said it will replace IL with visas that force migrants to reapply every 5 years. Is that going to be forever? That includes hundreds of thousands of migrants currently in the UK. Applicants would also have to meet certain criteria including a higher salary threshold and standard of English. That's already was here. Yes, we keep talking about migrants. Mig it feels like every politician now they forget to talk about the economy, talk about the NHS, talk about every other thing that is bordering this the country other than migration. Like it feels like migration or migrants is just the only problem of the UK right now. And legal migrants are not really the problem. That's what I want you guys to understand. But politics playing politics will just not let them see beyond the surface. Legal migrants are not your problem. We are contributing to the economy as well. Like we are here doing good, helping, contributing to the society and the economy. We are not even entitled to public funds. We're not taking anything. We pay for our houses ourselves. We pay for our feeding our everything. Even we pay for IHS fees. We pay our taxes even for our healthcare. But when you talk about migrants, the way they speak about immigrants, the way they talk, it seems like every one of us have committed offense. And it's not fair anymore. These people have to start giving credit to who credit is due because honestly I know yes is the UK is their country their rules their laws but at the same time we all are human beings. Like is it that you don't want migrants to breathe anymore? You don't want migrants to think. You don't want migrants to just you don't want them to do anything. It feels like once you're being called about to talk everything is migrant. We saw the Conerative Party as well, right? The leader of the Convictive Party, everything she keep talking about migrants cuz we all saw when she said that she's even going to extend British citizenship to 10 years, she's going to do that and do this like like what exactly is the problem? Want to do anything or make rules or regulations, you know, for the benefit of your people, of your country, that's fine. But stop rubbing it in our faces as if legal migrants are the problem. because migrants applied for visas and it was this same government that granted these visas. Okay, you are the ones that said you have shortage of staff and you want people to come in and fill up these gaps and people applied legally, applied for those jobs, got it, followed the due process, applied for their visas, paid all the money involved, got it. These people are not illiterates. You know, he keeps saying that these people are lowkilled workers as these who are the lowskilled workers. Is it nurses, doctors, engineers, construction workers? Who exactly are the low-skilled workers? There are skilled migrants, highly skilled professionals. So the way they talk about ILL like it's something that is just handed over to somebody for free. Getting ILR is already very strict. The process, the regulations, the rules, you have to show a lot of things before you can get ILR. Of course, you have to have met the rule of staying in the UK for 5 years, at least five years. You have to pass the life in the UK test. You have to pass the English test. You have to show good character, no criminal records, all those things. You have to prove and show all of that before you before you'll be considered for your indefinite leave to remain, right? But they talk about it like it's just peanuts. And then we pay through our noses for it. It's very very expensive. is one application that if you know a lot of families are not careful would leave you broke or take you back to square one is very very expensive people that apply for ILR and get it people that are qualified for it so many skilled and educated migrants have come to solve the shortage of staff or shortage crisis in different sectors I think it's high time legal migrants started getting respected because like what is all of this is tiring you turn on the news today and trust me it's not only just affect ing adults as well. It's going to affect children because everywhere you go to it's this the grants are doing this do that like is migrant the only problem of the world. What's going on? I understand that there are a lot of locals that don't even support these things you know these things that politicians are doing reform UK is not even in power yet they don't have the powers or the numbers to make such drastic change. So why make such a statement? See migrants are contributors. Okay, legal migrants especially are contributors. They are not the enemies. Okay, migrants work in the NHS, construction, you know, different sectors in the UK, social care, different sectors. They are building families, paying taxes, buying houses. So like what else do you want? And these numbers that you guys keep talking about that there are lots of you know the numbe\r\n",

Okay, we've heard them about emergency and we are moving to declare security zones and the president is saying that all these are at our disposal. The state of emergency is at our disposal but we we believe that what we've laid down now must work. Say that. Okay. Nobody has said that. In fact, the president did not say that. He the president said we have to move one step at a time. He said he will consider it as a last resort. Yes. Would you say we at the last resort? We have not gotten to that point. I think our plan is working and I'm saying to you, I was just on the Ankorra River just last week. 190 kilometers of the Ankorra River. I I I rode on almost oneird of it for three hours. And guess what? Left and right, there were people who continue to do GP, pump the water out and pump the poison back into the water and and this was last week. Yes. Yes, of course. In some of these areas, listen, this fight has taken over six regions with over 4 million people engaged in the art. Okay? And I'm I'm being honest with you. I am telling you that this problem is not going to be solved by aua alone. And it's not going to be solved because suddenly we come in and the next morning is gone. You see that turbidity levels the depth I've described it will take time to come back to the turn blue. It will take consistent effort. It will take the efforts of the community there. You know when I left what I did, I went to all the communities. I brought the chiefs and I asked them this is your community. This is where Shamfan machines that destroyed the water bodies are being manufactured right on the Anobra. I'm saying is that we are now backing this up with permanent army. You heard me warning that we are moving another step further and that step says we are going to declare all the water bodies and our forest security zones and you stay there and engage. Okay. So 17 minutes past the hour of the honorable minister lands natural resource. So clearly uh government has positioned again uh to move to another step and the step is that they declaring river bodies forest areas as national security zones environmental engineer or environmental engineer sorry the University of minds and technology environmental and safety environmental and safety um department. So clearly it tells you everybody seems to know you just heard the minister say clearly and I just wrote it here sir political apparatics I mean well Dr. on this on this matter but maybe Dr. on that morning clearly environmental and of course uh being at the University of minds and technology there it tells me sir uh there's much upper hand when it comes to some of these things but clearly let let me take your first um uh h on this one your your your your initial comments on what is really happening transpiring when it comes to where we've gotten to as we speak They can get. What has really happened? I want to know. Can you be clear? Oh, okay. So, uh there are certain commitments. One has to do with the other has to do with rivers. The other has to do with excavators from the other one has to do with security. Now the other one minister said yesterday they declaring river as a national security zone and they're going to put in permanent security people affected areas. He was even declaring almost about six regions are affected when it comes to this galam. So clearly these are some of the you have said exactly what I also know I think we on the same page. Sure minister the political players involved involved to bring the country this far. They should give him a break and that he is willing and ready to solve a problem. I think this is a very passionate voice. There is no punishment for the perpetrators. We know them pay. What is being their responsibility? The government is putting a lot of initiatives. No Ghana. A time will come there will be no Ghana. I don't know what we will have but we will not have the Ghana we know and we are just hoping say it will be as a good intention we expecting it to be. environment and technology and all that which has to do with the way and all that previous government came in with certain solutions to it. Now I'm talking about the present government is also coming up with another solutions to it and all clearly uh department what what what do you think will be the best solution to solve any environment how do you think it should be solved? How did we get here? That's the very first question we need to ask ourselves. It didn't happen overnight. Sure. activities. Nothing new has happened. We all know our actions and of course we know the output of what our action is going to be. We have gotten what we expect to get as a nation. Now the question is what is the way forward talking? Yes. The problem is we are pampering the perpetrators too much. Mhm. We are pampering them. You see they are ecoides in environmental toxicology toxicology ecosystem. Now because our life is dependent on the on the environment if for a few people a handful of people again and this how the country is going to go through I don't think we need to just sit and watch and be pumping the discussion on radios here and there we need to sw the beta pill we need harsh measures And the question is we as Ghanaians are we ready to fight or to deal with the Ghana say issue I don't I don't want the word fight because anytime you declare fight you have called two people the loser and the winner we are not fighting we should all deal with the situation at hand so are we ready to deal with the issue we should ask Ghanaian because different perspective Alterative livelihood for the people. You call this alternative livelihood when the future has been destroyed. There's this argument technocrats rather to really man these responsible institutions so that we will stop this political appointment on these areas. Do you think it's a is a good one? Yo, thank you very much. Ye\r\n",

         "Тексты с изображений\r\ntrump dominates ruth «less\r\nРасшифровки\r\nТранскрипт:This is the greatest thing about Trump. He will say the thing that everybody knows is true, but everybody in the UN is afraid to say. He exposes them in a way they've never been exposed before. And he did it in 45 minutes. The UN needs to get their act together. Like, what a dump. What a clown show that gets all this money from around the world accomplishes nothing. Gets all this money from America. Accomplishes nothing. He's Donald Trump's number one enemy in Congress. Chicago Senator Dick Durban. And now Dick Durban has a new scheme, a government takeover of your credit card. Today, consumers have thousands of choices in credit cards, all with equal, strong security. But Durban's plan is less competition and less security. And that means more risk for your credit and your identity. Tell Republicans in Congress, stop Dick Durban's takeover of your credit card before it's too late. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. Keep the fate. Hold the line and own the lids. It's time for our main event. Good Thursday to you. Welcome back to the Ruthless Friday program. I'm Josh Holmes along with Comfortably Smug, Michael Duncan and John Ashbrook, left to right across your radio dial. A lot going on here in the world and domestically. We're going to get to all of it. Uh, make sure to check out our video, full video that we did last night and put it up on the ICE shooting in Dallas. I think you're going to find that content pretty compelling because we go through a full history of how it is that we've gotten here and who's to blame, uh, the Democrats. Yeah. Yeah. And the and the clips up there on YouTube are fantastic. So definitely go check that out on YouTube. Go check that out. But we also have a lot of other news to cover. Yes. Uh you've all been aware of the fact that the president of the United States as well as much of the administration went up to New York for the UN United Nations big general assembly this week. And I don't know about you guys, but it seems to me like Trump going to the UN and I just like sort of thought of this on the walking into the here. It's like Jordan in the garden. Yeah, dude. That is good because it it it's like there's a hugely confrontational crowd. They know everyone hates him going in. It's the largest stage internationally. It's the only place where you know everyone is watching. And that he just deals out hard truths. And it seems like Trump gets better in that situation. Yeah. He he's like more comfortable with the uncomfortability of it than anyone I've ever seen on international stage. It's so funny you say that. I think it's also why he loves having these like open press sprays where he answers every question because I think he enjoys an adversarial environment. Like seems like you know what I mean? Like I think that's when he has his best stuff. It's like a a comedian who does crowd work and just wants to ask questions, you know, like that's when he gives you his best stuff. It it true. and he just seems to get stronger and welcome welcome the hate. Yeah. In a lot of ways. So the whole thing started off kicked off before they even walked into the joint in clip one. I'm sorry. I'm the president. I'm really sorry as the president of if you don't see it. Let me for our audio only listeners. He can't get in because the presidential motorcade is blocked. Guess what? I'm waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you. He and he's called President Trump on the phone. He's walking. Hilarious. [Laughter] We got Pepe Lew working his way through New York. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Taking pictures, walking through. So, what happened was uh he couldn't actually get to the United Nations building because the streets were shut down for Trump. Mhm. And he had to get out of his car and start walking and he calls Trump and asks Trump basically like, \"Hey, can you do something about this? I'm stuck. I can't get out.\" And he's like, \"H, you're going to have to walk.\" Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what did he think America first meant? Right. I mean, so he's on terapirma there in the United States, but as soon as you go to the UN, it's international soil. It's a hard concept for me to wrap my mind around. In the same ways that like embassies, I don't know how many of you guys know this, but embassies in in Washington DC, and there's a million of them. Every shitty country you've ever thought of has got some palatial building and but those are actually not American territory. Not my book. Right. as I agree with you. I've always They're all ours. Even the ones overseas, they're all ours. I totally agree with this, but but apparately because it's which is just wild. I mean, nothing talks about the magnanimity of the American people quite like the idea that we give some of the most important real estate in Manhattan of all places right over to the Euros and the UN and everybody else who does nothing. And you you you did some research on this. Turns out they don't pay taxes. Yeah. It doesn't appear that they pay property taxes. They don't seem to pay sales tax. They the only people who pay tax are the Americans who have regular jobs at the UN building. So if you're there cleaning up, not to mention the traffic jams, dude. Like the east side highways right where they are just making a whole town. I was in Manhattan on Tuesday and it was a parking lot. You couldn't get anywhere. Every time they do this to us. It it terrible. But all of that leads to this leadup to clip two, which you've probably seen, but I think marks an important distinction about what we're talking about. And I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter because the teleprompter is not working. I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless. And that way you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble. Think about that, dude. Like, think about like coming into this building in New York and you're Donald Trump, president of the United States and this whole place exists under your good graces. Yes. Right. And you show up and the teleprompter doesn't even work. You're the guy that they are choosing not to have the A team on. Yeah. Incredible. Right. And we're going to get into the second component of this clip 2B. All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen. But she's in great shape. We're both in good shape. We're both stood and they're all laughing. And then a teleprompter that didn't work. This is these are the two things I got from the United Nations. A bad escalator and a bad teleprompter. So, I mean, look, we we've all seen the video by now of the escalator situation, which ranges from a security concern, which is probably very real, to uh what Carolyn Lavit pointed out in that there were UN employees that were joking in a I think it was a London publication about uh how they would perhaps stop the escalators just to kind of prove that they needed more funding. for the UN. Ridiculous. US gives more money to the UN than any other country in the world. I'm so done with them. I'm so done with them. Like it is an absolute security risk. Uh especially for President Trump who has had nu I mean I think just the day that happened, one of his assassins was found guilty and tried to stick a pen in their own neck. Like uh they need to get their act together. They need to get their act together. President Trump needs to at all times be extremely safe and secure with a full appreciation, understanding of the number of times there have been attempts on his life. Number two, the UN needs to get their act together. Like what a dump. What a clown show that gets all this money from around the world accomplishes nothing. Gets all this money from America. Accomplishes nothing. I totally agree. Yeah. I mean, put Donald Trump's record of peace up against the UN. Yep. You know what I mean? Well, and he proceeded against rightfully did proceeded to go through that, right? And so he just makes a scathing case to the UN of like, you guys don't do [ __ ] First of all, your building sucks. My experience today has been terrible. Second of all, I'm the one that's doing the peacekeeping around here. What are you people up to? I've seven different occasions solved global conflicts on my own and I didn't even get so much as a call from you people. I love this about Trump. Yes. It's like for the most part every American president at some level has gone into that venue and had a point that they wanted people to follow, but it's like basically one point that is a a a major priority internationally that he's trying to drive the UN towards and then they make nice and they talk about common goals and they do whatever. Not Trump. Trump walks into that thing and he's like, I've got a lot to say here. I It's a listing of grievances to start with. Second of all, I got a lot of things that you guys are doing shitty that I think I'm going to tell you about and make you super uncomfortable because nobody else in this room or this shitty compilation of United Nations are going to discuss if I don't. And you all recall the first time around when he went in in 2017. Oh, he's so confrontational. Oh, what is he doing? Oh my gosh, we're going to get lose so much respect in the world. And what he was talking about is ponying up for their mutual security. Mhm. And they all laughed him out of the room and they're like, \"Oh god, he's just an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about.\" And 5 years later, they're all racing to double the commitment that he asked him to make because they knew he was right. And then the second thing that he talked about, does it make a lot of sense that you people are buying energy from somebody that you formed an entire alliance? Yeah. Yeah, the whole NATO try to prevent, you know, like you got an entire security thing t\r\n",

You know, he was supposed to be here this morning. He explained that in fact he couldn't get home yesterday or something like that um due to the traffic. He traveled and so long story and um he to be fair to him he volunteered to do this uh program by Zoom. But I I said that look the kind of discussion I want to have with him. It's such that I'd like us to to be close by. Um I I don't know if you've noticed if you try to do interviews by Zoom or by telephone usually it will become an interview but sometimes what you want to have is a discussion and there's something about you being with the person you know close by and so on and so forth. I opted to to let it go to let it let it go and we'll choose a more suitable day next time. I'm so sorry about that. But um these floods will go with all kinds of casualties. Um all kind attached to them. Do do you do are my sentiments right or wrong? You didn't because of No, because of the interview. Yeah. Why why I'd rather have him live in the studio instead of having him by Zoom? Yes, because um there are other factors that um that can affect Zoom at any point in time. It's it's quite unpredictable. Very very unpredictable. Then you have interruptions and it's it's it's quite a a serious um matter. Um I was I was in the forefront of hoping that we'd have um an airline um that that would play very prominent role on the international front and I also am one of those who believe that government would have nothing entirely to do with a national airline that we could I believe I'm one of those who believe that we could have a national aine without it being owned by the government and you can see the various attempts Um I remember the days of Nigeria Airways. Um maybe some of us also what we found on ground. Um Niger ways every top gun could even I remember back in the day too we had friends in the military who could open up their ticket for you and you go on the plane. Wow. Yes. I was tell just like that. Yes. Now ah in the military for example in the military in the military's office if you want to go somewhere he could write that a ticket he had the tickets he had blank tickets oh at least for local flights I don't know what it is about and yes journalist too back in the day would just when you couldn't there were no phone calls but he walk up to the office go to kon go there so and I and I also know that government cured. Oh, the military incured a lot of deaths. Nigeria Airways, we'll leave the story for Nigeria Airways. We'll never talk about it again because it will open up old wounds. So, had been in the forefront and I must give him at the credit for having set up air piece. Um, but I believe that the airline should outgrow him. That that is where I'm gravitating to. I I believe that in the national spirit he should make sure that the airline outgrows him meaning that he doesn't solely own the airline as it were per se. Um he he has done well relatively they have a lot of problems I was going to highlight with um day and find out from a professional standpoint apart from lateness and so on and so forth. operationally generally I believe um very strongly that you need to repackage a new management for that airline possibly without the getting involved. Those are one of the things I wanted to start out on. Repackage the airline putting putting proper independent management independent of the MD independent of all influences. Um because again when things happen um the airline has always given an impression that they take these things personal like when they couldn't get a slot in uh in He made it all sound personal is because of this is because of that and anytime they have uh there's an issue with the regulator is always appears as if the regulator has matter fact there was a time it was also the tribal element also who you know came into this. So these were some of the things I was going to take up with um but I I I think that all of us need to gather together and make sure that that airline um succeeds um the benefits are many. Look at now the new the new arrangement signed by the government um which the president was able to sign when he went to Brazil. It has an air packact between Nigeria and Brazil. And from the way I look at it, it looks as if airpace will have a monopoly of that route because my friends in Brazil have told me that it's not likely their own airline for now is going to be able to so because when I asked my friend, my friend invited me to come over to present and said ear you know so I mean it's good the Nigerian flag also there's a story here on a vacation that they're going to start flying not air piso but Tanzanian airliner. Well, I don't know how many people go to. Have you ever been to Tanzania before? No, I would love to. The funny thing is that every time I hear Tanzania, I remember Tangayika which was the original name. Tangika. Tangika. Yes. which was the name that I that we had when and I remember Juler their leader who after being president I think it was even the governor that built the only bungalow he had after fighting for independence being president and so on and so forth they don't cut them like that um they don't cut them like that anymore so what what we're going to do is um Um, I mean, there are probably one or two stories that came up this morning that we didn't have time to look at. I'm going to look at that. Then, of course, we can open up our lines and you might want to um to contribute. The first story that caught my mind this morning that we didn't have time to look at is a story that is credited to First Bank. And the story said that First Bank is to unveil a disability friendly banking service. And that struck me. Let me read the story. It says that in a move to improve accessibility, First Bank of Nigeria has announced roll out of specialized banking services for customers with visual and physical disabilities. This is quite impressive. The initiative according to the bank underscores his commitment. Okay. All the corporate whatever is said there. Patrick Akideno the chief risk and chairman of the first bank sub committee said the program is designed to ensure that all customers regardless of ability can independently and securely access services. Okay. So what will it be? Let me see. The phase the phase rollout will extend across all first bank subsidiaries and locations introducing several innovations. What are these innovations? These include transaction documents in braille. Okay. Audio, large print and digital formats, enhanced ATM with high contrast screens and voice prompt commands and debit cards featuring tactile motives and braille inscriptions. Yeah, it's very good. I I saw this. In fact, I saw this story yesterday. We miss it. We miss it today. And now I'm glad I have the opportunity. Let me repeat again. First bank is targeting so that you can do your transaction documents are in braille. Uh um this braille audio large print and digital formats enhanced ATMs with high contrast screens and voice prompt commands and debit cards featuring tactile motives and braid inscriptions. Now to further security, the bank would employ enhanced soft spins and tokens. Soft pins and tokens while product brochures will be made available to accessible formats to improve engagement. Um then of course the PR part of it in align with CBN's financial inclusion strategy uh blah blah blah blah blah to and as well as United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which advocate equal access to financial services. I I wonder what it's like now. um sheriff I wonder if there's any bank or top institution for that matter that has any provisions for people with challenges even even in as much as the access itself sometimes look there's one of the big banks there on what's this what's this street called I just said even I I find it difficult to climb the staircase to get up to the bank it's very steep very very stiff. I with my legs still walking. Sometimes I find it your leg works. It works. Very how many times. Okay. But I do I find it very stiff. So I can imagine anybody with a disability is not going to go into that. Yeah. Now, so I I'd like to challenge the banks to contact us and let us know which of their branches are disability friendly. Very good. Which of their This is a challenge to all the banks, Zenith, Access, GTB, all the big boys. Which of your branches can we tell our customers are are accessible for people with physical challenges? Because see part of the problem we have is that let's call a speed a spade and the attitude has to change once you are physically challenged h in this country you are bound to defeat you have to get everything done by yourself but I remember oh good old Kyogi and a few others I've remember them seen them turning up at at the studio now and I'm asking how how did you get here? M Kadi used to come here by himself. Yes. Yeah. There's a another younger lawyer. He used to work with my late brother. Yeah. I think he was here. Yeah. The day he turned up, I was stunned. And so he said um I said, \"So where are you going from here?\" He said he was going to was it Ketu? I I'm not going to go down. He said he knows that he'll get down at stadium and find his way to Ketu. Oh, but I know a lot of these are uh they're like personal um whatever. It's important that we we we tend to realize that the same thing for sorry boss the same thing for our public transport and that is even worse. That's even worse. Um so we must we must come to the realization that if you see um uh London transport for example you're disabled you're on a wheelchair if you see the problem the driver goes through to make sure that you bought that vehicle he would tilt the he will come down he will tilt the bus then he has he has a slide and he will physically himself unless of course you are being accompanied he will push your your router onto the ball. He's going to delay that bus by two, three minutes, but so be it. But so be it. Um I like that. Yes, but so so be it. And I and I usually tell people that and of course we call it spade is paid. Some people scorn at physically disabled people forgetting that the only day you are free from physical disability is the day you die. Is the day you die and a fellow had had an inscription that dead body accident. So is the day you die that you can say you're free. Your life can turn around immediately. We should always have that at the back of our minds. I agree. anytime something happens to another person or I say the first thing I ask I I usually ask myself or say to myself that it could jolly well be me and once we once we have that attitude um so I I I'm glad what first bank has done um this is an open invitation to uh we will look for him but in case anybody Mr. Patrick Aki Akideno he's the chair risk officer whatever it's an open invitation for him we like him to come to the studio to explain to us how exactly this new arrangement is going to work uh if there are other banks that are doing it we would like to know but if there are no other banks doing it we like to thank first bank for um taking the initiative to make life more pleasurable for disabled um people. There's also another related story here which we couldn't take this morning. What's the time, Sherry? Yes, we're 19. Okay. And it has to do with the National Association of Resident Doctors again and again and again and again. They are bringing out suggestions as to what we can do to to to to stop the drift of our medical personnel, not just doctors. Not just doctors. And we'd like to beg the politicians, you found a problem with the judiciary, you handled it right. Do the same likewise for for for medicine because it it affects everybody. It affects everybody. How can you you're ready to treat judges like whatever and you're not going to do the same for doctors, right? I think same for lecturers, same for same lecturers. The doctors say migration of medical personnel is putting pressure on the health care system. If you go to the hospitals these days, even the private ones, sheriff, even the p private ones for the rich and everything, if you go, the cues are so long. My Jack was telling me the other day that he went to a government hospital in the Kenya. I like my you know, he's quite he's a patriotic Nigerian. He likes likes to do things prim and proper. Money, uncle. Okay. Yeah, he's uncle to me. He's au to me. He's a small boy. A small boy. So when he said morning uncle, I was wondering who I kept looking. So and he was telling me that what for checkup just to take up to see his doctor. He went to this particular hospital. He got there at 7:00. He had a novel in hand. He saw his doctor at 5. 5:00 p.m. Yes. and and and and I was looking at his mood when he was talking because the first thing I wanted to ask him is ah the same Nigerian thing. Do you know somebody you can see through the back end and so on? But we can't continue to run AC. And by the way, my doctor in the UK is my personal friend. We went to went to university together. I can't jump the to see him in his own hospital. I can't I can't jump. I can't jump the queue to see him. I have to get an appointment like everybody. Because if I did that and isn't is not hospital the patients have the right to complain and if care is not taken is is practice could be shut down. So I was tempted to ask my da my wants to be like every other person. So I said fine. So he he left. He said he got there at seven novel in hand or book in hand. I don't know whether it was no he didn't see the doctor until 5. Wow. But it's not even any better in the private hospitals. Some of the most expensive hospitals people attend to even in VR here. Some of I don't want to mention the name of the clinics. I've known people who have spent hours trying to see a doctor specialist. So that tells you that immediately tells you that there is a mass shortage. As for nurses is even worse worse because when my late brother was on admission in Luth I knew for sure I was told quite well that there is a shortage of nurses and we we can't sit back and do nothing about it and the people must must take their their lives their faith in their hands and force these politicians because they are well well taken care of though sometimes God gets to the detail. There was a a big man who who who had an accident here. I always like to tell the story. It's a good example. Top gone military officer in those days. He had an accident and they quickly rushed him onto the air ambulance. They were able to rustle an ambulance. He died me there before the thing plane level. And my good friend, the late Dr. Koop, not you know his elder brother, late Dr. who is a head specialist. He he said when a thing like that like speaking out of his voice, God bless his soul. I miss him so much. When an accident like that happens, the treatment start from where the man is. You don't even touch him. You don't even carry him. If you like, let it happen in the in the boot of Ubul or whatever, you have to stabilize him until the doctor comes. And then guess what? the people, the os who at the other end waiting for them. Oh, time. Yes. Oh, this is just getting sweet. I'll take a short break and then we'll be right back. [Music] More news and information coming up. We'll be back in a moment.

While unpacking, she pulled out John Ben's 3in-1 chocolate and started hyping it. Creamy, tasty, and more. I just smelled and nodded. taking her seriously. Fast forward 2 weeks, I'm calling her asking where she bought it because I need more for my family. Once you've had a taste of instant goodness, the original going back. John Vent 3in1 chocolate. Enjoy instant goodness. This is where the headlines meet the hot takes. All the feelings of the people knowing that Fra is set to return as governor of River State. We have crisis before, we have actions during, and definitely there will be some actions after. regulation of food prices. I think that some miracle is supposed to happen and our magician is the president. The farmers that you are giving directive they say you want to crash the food price that not only farmer you know some of these monies that we've continuously been taxed take seriously or they were just brought in by devil to come and make us suffer. State government has lamented that youth take weapons and food to bandits. Nigeria's investors who are in Midas are complaining you are asking investors who are not in Nigeria to come and invest. Are you kidding me? Stay with us on 99.3 Nigeria info. Let's talk. You're listening to Jimmy right here on 99.3 Nigeria. Nigeria info. Hey. [Music] Okay. So, you're welcome back to the Daily Digest. One more time, I apologize uh because of the circumstances of Lumin was not here. We'll do it again next week. Um but I was then before we went on break, I was talking about um health and what was it I was talking about? Do you remember? I think I've forgotten. So, all kinds of have gone. Gone. Okay. But I I I think essentially essentially what what we're saying is that we'd like you know the government to pay premium on health services and um look at what the enemy are saying here on its part. The Nigerian medical association at land key measures government must adopt to stem the exodus of doctors. There are four major things government can do to stop the jawa syndrome. One of course is um first improve remuneration towards consolid I don't know what it is but please pay doctors well pay them as well as you pay magistrates and judges they are equally important if not more important second provide better welfare package when I was growing up I I I will always repeat the country that I grew up in that make me so passionate about this country if you are a young doctor if you if you you were doing Houseman, you'd live on the premises of Luth or General Hospital. Okay? They had like a a mini like some kind of mini flat for house doctors. And you were given a car loan when you were doing your house. So when it's time for youth call, they'll most likely come with come with a brand new car. That was why as a young man, I I totally hated if I could inject them with something. I hated doctors and pilots. I hope my friend Hus is not listening to because these were the people who are settled by society far ahead of the rest of us. It's just a joke really. But you see so I I remember I remember that Dr. I don't know where is now. We used to take his master 9 through9. Imagine he got it that car loan brand new to we were the ones who took up that were the ones who took off the he was a red red master Mazda 929 with with cream upholstery. Oh sh you don't know what you've been missing. I don't know. That's the way doctors were treated. You would want to be a doctor. You would want to be a doctor because doctors are okay. So I'd like to be corrected. I wish I could get one of them. I think they were put on level nine, government level nine when you're doing your house man because you would have done five but even pharmacy students did the same thing. So the issue of jackpower was at the better maybe those who wanted to help their academics but what we have now is a complete disaster. It's a complete disaster. So uh they they also talk about um a professional allowances and implementation of non- taxable call duty. The other day we heard of a doctor who had worked for 72 hours and collapsed and died. Oh yes. Yes. Um provide better welfare packages including housing loans spread over 10 to 15 years and car loans over 5 years. Third, invest in the training and retraining of doctors locally locally and abroad. Okay. Fourth, improve infrastructure and creative. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to drag Dr. down here next week. Okay. From the old school uh medical school so that he can learn the voice and you know um actually give us what it was like when he started out as a is a big time doctor. He had his own clinic, but he can say how how it was when he when he started out and he he said association of medical laboratory science um scientists said that Nigeria is bleeding from the health workforce exodus even the nurses you discover that a lot of those who are even those who didn't bother to do nursing initially now go quickly go and do nursing two three years um I know somebody who was with with me um a young lady then uh in the vanguard when I was in the vanguard I was a young man too all running around the place today she's one of the she's even retired now she's one of the big psych psychiatrist nurses baby as part of her retirement package new not we I like to bring things down so that you can get a feel. It's not to to see them in abstract, better this, better that. It's for you to get a feel of what it used to be in the past. And uh so that okay, let's open up our lines in case you have something to say um about all the things I've said today. 0201 2770993 and 0201-465719. Please remember if anybody can help, we will try to get in touch with the first bank. We'd like them to come and explain in detail what it is that they have for um people with disabilities. Good morning. Hello. Ah Kelvin now agrector none of them get treated here h even it has gone that bad that local government chairman now go abroad for medical treatment yes I don't want to mention local government that are going abroad now for treatment with state money before the use no I don't I don't vex I just said it. So as long as these politicians are not treated here and their families are not treated yet like your words, let me borrow your words, they will abandon all of us to the Philistines. Yes. It's a shame that in this same country the royal family was coming here for medical treatment. It has been said several times on this platform how the royal family were were coming the Saudi royal family. Yes. 62 and all of a sudden it is reversed the case. I was reading the report of the medical of J in 2003 alone when Dr. Chris was telling us that we have more doctors that have almost 2,000 doctors left Nigeria in Japan. Okay. Dr. They were telling us h we don't have shortage of doctors everybody everything is well this in 2024 last year it has to almost 4,000 doctors that have left it's not my record it's not my report they should go and check the medical house so where do we go from here I know what I have faced in the past two three weeks and it's not a public hospital yes eventually we lost my mother-in-law very sorry about that we in we in a mess We don't know where we are headed. Except those that want to see go and get the original eye like say don't use a eye. If you use everything get that where it's not a good place. Thank you. Okay. Talking about eye doesn't mean that you should remove your eye and put another eye. No, don't take it literally. He's referring to fell song called Big Blind Country which I think is on YouTube. Ah, by the way, tomorrow my my my son is my borrowed stolen son Madakuti. He's going to be 30. So, in case I forget, somebody should remind me to wish him a happy birthday. Madi will be 30 tomorrow and he's he's done very very well for himself. I'm so proud of him. I've told Fei that he should be very careful if I have enough money to go and do some DNA cleaners. But uh M in case I forget tomorrow, tomorrow is M's birthday. It's going to be 30 and I think there will be JJ Mus and Baby Mus, but I don't know where. Well, I'll look for it. I'll look for it because I must eat the rice of my son. Oh yeah, let's go again. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. This is Kenny, Uncle Jimmy. Hey, Kenny. Hannah, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Hi, Sheriff. No, Uncle Jimmy. Know somebody that is currently under house manship? Yes. and he's almost wrapping up next month. You know, he hasn't got paid one month salary from a military hospital. What I'm telling you, the only beauty about this is that yes, they give them nice quarters, you know, every doctor to their own suite, you know, their mini kitchen with a brand new stove and all that, but they haven't been paid and they're almost wrapping up. So, that's why you have that right there. The only other thing I would say that they do in quote well you know in inverted common is that doctors get about 150k for NYC and that was at the time when regulars you know people were getting like 33k I don't know if it's been reversed upwards or not but yeah they have a long way to go in order to retain our doctors I'm all for doctors and medical people jacking they have no I mean now for goodness sake how many years you've worked here and you know you study here and then you get paid peanuts. No, now good job, Uncle Jimmy. I appreciate your show. All right. Um, yes. Um, I don't know how much they pay them my youth service now, but there's a need to review. You see what what I find objectionable. Let me be very very is why we keep making this noise over and over again. We made the noise, a little noise for the judges. It was done. We didn't need to make noise for the public office as they then grab everything by themselves, bought themselves, 160 million naira car and all kinds of things. But the doctors who would treat us the masses there's an element of wickedness in all this. I cannot be convinced otherwise. There's an element of nonalance and what might translate to outright wickedness in all this not wanting to make help of Yeah. You want to say something? I I just have a message. Okay. Yes. Uh this is from He says, \"My name is Dr. Alu. I work in t...",

The people's breakfast. Your morning. Your voice. Your journey. Good morning. Good morning, my neighbor. Welcome to the home of hard truths and bold insights. Radio Generation. 601 and 22 seconds. It is. This is Radio Generation. My name is Moana and uh you are tuned in to 88.8 FM in Nairobi and 90.7 in Mombasa. A very good morning to you. You can let us know where you're listening from. By the way, you can find us on our socials that is at radioenk across all of them and on YouTube at radiogeneration Kenya saw. My name is Malami and seated across me is none other than CT muga. Mr. Muga, a very good morning to you. Morning you Paul. How are you? Minos salamana. Yes. Yeah. Um I'm feeling great this morning. Had a hot cup of coffee before I got to the office. So I'm feeling energized and rejuvenated and um you know I have that jolt of energy inside me. Good for you. Yeah. Coffee. Coffee. Yes. All right. Do you take anything other than coffee? Tea. What I drink in abundance is actually water. Mhm. Yes. I mean, water is normal. That's why I'm not asking because it isn't normal. Very many people who drink probably just one glass a day. I drink a heck of a lot of water. I am that one glass a day person. Yes. That's what I'm saying. When I say I drink water, I don't mean I sip one glass a day. Yeah. I drink something like 3 or 4 liters a day. Wait, what? I drink something like 3 or 4 liters of water a day. For why? For why? Because it is healthy. 3 to four liters a day. Not in one sitting. Yeah. Of I mean I know it's not like that you'll take 1, two, 3. It's not like that. It's not like that. But you're regularly taking water. I am regularly taking water. If I go somewhere and I'm sitting and people having a drink, I ask for water and I ask for a liter which I sip quietly. Sometimes I usually forget to take water like literally. It's all right. Yeah, you will. It's not all right. I I need to create a habit. Well, you haven't created a habit. I'm saying it's all right because you haven't seen the need. The day you see the need, yeah, you'll create the habit. But so far, you haven't. So, it is all right that you haven't. On the day you create the habit, it'll also be all right. There's a time uh like 3 or 4 years back I literally had to put an alarm to remind me to take water. You are a consumer of our alcoholic beverages. You should drink a lot of water, sir. But you see what I'm talking about. Dehydrates you. I know. I know what I'm what I'm trying to say is that I take I I literally some like then I I I jump on a glass or two then I chill again and then I forget until the next day. Don't worry the importance of water will hit you on these days and when it does you will not need a reminder. Why does that sound like a like a threat? Like I am actually merely stating a fact. the importance of it, right, will hit you. When it does, you will not need a reminder. Okay. All right. But just if it's any consolation, you're not alone. Mhm. [Music] water. Yes. So you have to replenish it. Yes. Today is the 25th day of 202 um 5 that is September and um the United Nations is celebrating World Maritime Day. World Maritime Day. And uh the theme for this particular day is our ocean, our obligation, our opportunity. Several initiatives will take place today to commemorate the day including and not limited to lighting up landmarks. So every um international maritime authority um headquarter will be bathed in blue light in the evening of the day that is today to promote this year's theme. And of course IMO invites member states, intergovernmental organizations in cooperation with IMO and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with IMO to light up landmarks. So, in case today you're driving somewhere or you're walking somewhere in the evening and then you see it's been lit blue, chances are it's because they are um celebrating World Maritime Day. A day I didn't even think existed. But yo, the United Nations has got everything for everything. A day for everything rather. But it's important because um our oceans are very very critical and important. They're actually very critical to our very existence. Without them, chances are we wouldn't be here. So big shout out to our ocean. If at all it will receive that shout out. Oh yes. [Applause] [Music] Yes. The the proverb I found particularly interesting to the point of being hilarious. The bald woman boasts of her sister's hair. The bald woman. Bald. Bald. Bald. Bald. It's bald. Okay. Woman boasts of her sister's hair. Mhm. Right. The bald woman boasts of her sister's hair. But then the other communities on this planet and on this in this country where somebody will boast of his relatives achievement. Yes. [Music] Mhm. [Music] And in this case, [Music] that's interesting. But I wouldn't expect people in ladies in Tunisia specifically to be bald. No, no, no. That's the beauty of a proverb. What do you think they're trying to say? To be honest, I I don't know. Are they um you know, are they are they celebrating the beauty of their sisters or or is it like what what what is the deeper meaning? I like the way you respond to questions. I ask you what you think the deeper meaning is and then I say I don't know. I said what what is meaning? No, you what do you think? I didn't say give me the exact meaning of it because an an exact meaning doesn't exist. What do you think? Think please. Okay, let me think. I think it means to be honest I can't think. Maybe it's the coffee. Did you hear the Carthaginians? No. You never studied history? No. Ancient Carthage? Carthage I know I know about. vers. Now that my friend is Tunisia. Uh-huh. Okay. It's rich in history. It was part of the Roman Empire. The Romans claimed as an empire at some point. I am actually separating the time of the Roman rule over it. Okay. With its existence even prior to that. It was a civilization that existed on its own. All right. S. And in a previous time before the occupation of the Romans, they are the ones who had occupied some of those countries around the Mediterranean. Okay. All right. And one sees remnants of their culture in some of those areas. What is it that makes other people take pride in someone else's? It meaning I may not have done well for myself, but my friend, don't treat me as someone who's insignificant. My own blood sister, my own blood brother is a significant person. and I come from that family. So I am not a nobody. Okay. Yes. That's profound. Yes. Yeah. Let me use a phrase that I hear using. Geniuses. [Music] All right. So, a bold woman takes pride in her sister's hair. Yes. Interesting. Thank you for that one, Mr. CT. We truly appreciate it. And it's time for us to jump on to something called our website. Now, in case you're joining us for the first time, first of all, a very much welcome to you. We have a website that is rk.co.ke where not only do you get to see us live, you also get to listen to us live. And most importantly, you'll get to see some of the stories that have actually you get to see all the stories that have been making headlines in the last couple of hours. And these are stories of significance. Whether it's in news, sports, politics, whether it's in business, technology, entertainment, education, you name it, you'll find it on rg.co.ke. [Music] For instance, the first story that we're going to interact with is and they keep on updating every few minutes. So don't think that the one I'm reading right now depart in the next two minutes. So for instance, R demands Gaza ceasefire. It does. Yeah. Yeah. hostage release and strong Haiti support. So, yeah, that is United Nations General Assembly abbreviated. Okay. around the world like President William R has urged the international community to push for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the unconditional release of hostages saying that the protection of civilians and adherence to humanitarian law must never be selective. Addressing the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, R said that the suffering of innocent people in conflict zones including Gaza and Sudan cannot be ignored. He resisted that a credible political process is the only path to lasting peace. Oh, he insisted, not resisted, he insisted that a credible political process is the only path to lasting peace. So our president said what he said and yeah so [Music] well he's joining very many voices. Yes of course remember very members of the European Union have stated categorically that they recognize the state of Palestine. Oh yes um France did that just a day or two ago. The United Kingdom did the same and many other countries. Oh yes. M so what does that mean though for what does that mean for what does that mean for for Israel and specifically to to you know talking about uh their prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the state of Israel did not exist in 1944 as it's currently constituted that land mass was called Palestine all right so we know how the history goes we know what happened and we keep talking about 1947 the 94 declaration blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. What I have found particularly interesting is how Britain Yeah. and their friends the uh um the French Yes. These are people who are in Europe. They come to what they now they they call the Middle East and they they decide they decide that uh these people who are called Palestinians can just be moved so that uh somebody uh else can come and occupy the land. Mhm. Okay. Yes. What they forget is that this problem did not begin in the Balffor declaration of 1917. This began in 1916. Yeah. The Sykes Picot agreement signed by France and Britain to carve out land previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Okay. That's how it started. Mhm. Then the Balffor Declaration now cemented this. The idea was you cover a piece of a piece. But that is not what has happened over time. Over time, all that they've done, yes, is just keep pushing for more land and pushing and creating settlers, pushing and creating settlers. That's actually what they've done. Meaning, you set about removing people from land which was theirs. You brought in other people. Mhm. These fellows didn't seem to have a problem sharing this land with these people. But then the owners of the land are now the ones who own the smallest port of the land which was previously theirs. Yeah. So, so what then would be the solution? city. The discussion about um two states, Palestine existing as a state and Israel existing, if you look at the narratives that um have been predominant in this discussion is a refusal by successive governments in Israel to actually accept that idea, the two-state solution. And the one time you had a prime minister who actually sought to have this done, that fellow got himself assassinated for his efforts. Mhm. Okay. So there are people who are determined. But for such a thing to actually happen, for such a thing to take root, there must be an arching narrative. A narrative that or narratives that propel people to believe that what they're doing is justified. Mhm. Okay. I'm reminded of a story. I visited the land of Israel with u the church that I go to. Okay. And one of the things that struck me, our tour guide was an Israeli gentleman. Our driver Yes. was an Arab Palestinian. What do you call a Palestinian? An Arab. And there are comments that our tour guide kept making until I actually had to ask him Yeah. quietly. He'd pass some buildings and he'd say, \"You know, these buildings which seem half finished, they belong to the Arabs.\" I said, \"How do you know?\" Said, \"Yeah, but Arabs never finished their buildings.\" I said, \"Well, how?\" Said, \"Well, according to our laws, if the exterior of the building is not completed according to the required standards, then you don't pay tax.\" So, they like avoiding tax. So, I I kept quiet and asked, \"But our driver is Arab. You know, you what you're saying is a little derogatory, aren't you?\" Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. that these people again this is what he said he's a young man these people are like that I we were a busload of people I pulled him aside later and told him chief the bus driver uncomfortable cuz I was watching him you are speaking disrespectfully to this person yes it never occurred to me to recall this until I started seeing what was happening in recent time I realized there has to be a dominant narrative that people have and it's the kind of narrative that led to the genocide in Rwanda. It is the kind of narrative that was there when we talk about the Holocaust. There are always narratives. One of them is that these people are not human beings like us. They're inferior. Thank you. It's the same narrative that propelled apatide. Okay. Same narrative. So you are more more or less justified the narrative of civilizing the native the missionaries who first came. It's a narrative. M there must be a narrative that drives certain people in the population of Israel cuz it's not all of them. Yeah. Those who are I'm told are referred to as a Zionist to be able to do what they do and because they believe they actually believe they've gone to a point where they've accepted and they believe that that is so. Okay. So when they do it it's like they're doing it from a righteous position. And yet if you look at it Yes. You've dehumanized other human beings like yourself. You've considered them to be subhuman but more importantly you've considered that you are right and then that right of yours cannot be questioned and you know it's actually a very crazy for me I actually call it crazy because that that is what it is. I don't even write here back at home about certain communities but I don't think it has ever gotten to this level. Actually you've stated a fundamental point Paul that is why we must not I remember once in a talk show there was an issue that had arisen at the coast and we had a member of parliament from another region of the country it was a mai issue and the person then commented and said but you know these people at the coast are very lazy I said what it's a narrative that some people hold meaning you are justified Yeah. In plundering what is theirs because they are lazy. These are a people who've been living and they have a civilization that has thrived for a very long time and somehow they lazy. We all have those narratives and that's what we must guard against because it then enables you. We saw it rearing its head when we had our problems in 2008. Why? You first of all begin by profiling that person. M then you dehumanize them by creating a narrative that names them as subhuman. You have you've begun. So the harm that is being done to these people is not being done to a human being. Yeah. We must really guard against these narratives. They are dangerous. They are extremely dangerous. Different with someone on policy, differ with someone on opinion. differ with someone on matters of of of ideology, but the moment you profile, you are on a slippery slope. I agree. CS Mcommen warns against desecration of the Kenyan flag. Uhhuh. Uh, this one I'm sure you've seen a couple of videos going around there. Interior National Administration cabinet secretary Kipumen has warned that anyone found desecrating Kenya's national flag or symbols will face legal consequences. He stressed that the law is clear on the matter and offenders will not be spared. Speaking during the 45th Jala Salama security forum in Wajia County on Wednesday, Murin condemned a recent incident at Na National Stadium where a group of fans was filmed stomping and kicking the Kenyan flag during a cuff champions uh league match. you know, um I've I've actually seen many other videos um insulting Kenya, the Kenyan flag, and then insulting Kenyans in general, saying that, \"Oh, you know, you're just keyboard warriors.\" And I'm I'm just paraphrasing here, but you're just keyboard warriors. All you do is you know how to complain behind the desk, but you can never do anything. And this person was saying that I will even come to the stadium and I will do this and that and I will even burn that flag. And I was like, \"Yeah, but you know, you know, you know, [Music] no there are things you do not give credit by responding to. You know why?\" Yeah. What exactly does such a person hope to achieve by that ranting? [Music] So I narrow it down to one simple perspective. You must distinguish between your problem and someone else's. [Music] Yes. Hey how do we have that problem? Yeah. We are keyboard warers. Yes we are. Yeah. We complain. Yes we do. And and yes exactly by us doing those things. Okay, we've heard you. So, so exactly where's the problem exactly? Yeah. Yes. I mean, uh, and like you said, don't qualify that thing by even responding to it. Let it be. If that's how you think, then we've understood how you think and we leave it at that. Lecturers push for jail of cabinet secretaries as strike criminals universities. And I'm laughing this about this because um how realistic is this? It absolutely it can't even take off. So lecturers are pushing for jail of cabinet secretaries as strike cripples universities. Again story that has been published about an hour ago. Learning in public in universities has ground to a halt for the seventh day as lecturers press on with their strike. Now escalating the standoff into the courts by seeking the imprisonment of three cabinet secretaries over a failure to honor salary agreements worth billions. Now Yasu that is the university's academic staff union through lawyer Titus Co has filed a contempt case targeting education cabinet secretary Julius Okamba, Treasury CS John and Labour CS Alfred Muta. Also cited in the case are Attorney General Dorcas Odor, Salaries and Remuneration Commission, uh, Secretary Margaret Joker, Interpublic Universities Council's Consultative Forum, uh, Chairperson Professor Fred Simu Barasa and Secretary Professor Daniel Mugendi. Professor Daniel Mugendi used to be at KU at one point and he was the deputy vice chancellor in charge of uh, oh my goodness, why am I forgetting? But yeah, I remember he was the DVC when I was in campus back back in the day. Doc, Professor Mugendi was a very cool guy. Um, and I also know Professor Simasa Fredasa [Music] yesterday when we were Who are we talking to? I think we were talking to Yeah. Dr. Pet. One thing that Dr. Peter Bay pointed out is the fact that in the government that he served at the time that he served it, things were not moving because key decisions were not with the the principles or the secretaries or the CSS and everyone else uh that was involved in ministries and that they had to uh you know confirm their orders or even confirm their activities and duties with state house. So I think we might be wasting our energy on saying that we need to um arrest or jail the CSS Julius Aamba, John Baddy, Alfred Muta and all these other people that have been mentioned in this because come for lack of a better word these people are just flower girls in the office surely. What are we saying? You know the that's a narrative isn't it? Yeah of course we are just going with what Dr. Peter and while he was there I always have um a query whenever I hear these things and you heard me express it yesterday. Uhhuh. What stops you from raising an issue when you actually there while you're in the government? Yes. Well, for example, he said he was being frustrated because every time he wants to um um action anything, he would be told, \"Go, I'mma have you confirmed with so and so?\" And he was like, \"Why do I need to confirm with so and so? my work is is cut out. My job description is very clear. Why? Why do I need to? And he was saying that he kept on getting calls from state house and people close to the president. And he was like, \"Guys, what are we doing?\" Did he not understand the system he was in? Let me let me explain something here. Mhm. This is akin to what we hear of well this narrative that is stated that parliament has been captured. Yes. That that in my opinion is absolutely bloody ash. It's not true. Parliament being captured. It's not true. Okay. Parliament parliamentarians have surrendered the birthight we gave them to represent us with. They are the ones who have surrendered it. The capture was not forcible. No. No. They gave it. They willingly abandoned the the independence. They had the freedom that we had given them. They abandoned it. the pieces of silver that are involved we don't know but they abandoned it. So this idea of capture because that narrative then blames the executive. There is no executive on this planet that does not try to influence parliament. None. You see what you've said there is no executive that doesn't attempt or try yes to influence their parliament. None. But the question is how do they do it? And also the parliaments that have been you know attempted do they fold? Do they agree? Do they sell that birthright? You see the beauty is that we had parliament where the opposition was in essence within the same party cuz we had a one party state and there were very dire consequences. But with the one party state there were people who would oppose the government. They have been elected on that party ticket and they're opposing it. Yeah. Just think about that extremity. Mhm. With the advent of multipartism, it became clearer. People got detained. The laws allowed for detention. People got jailed because they expressed contrary opinions. Okay. Mhm. It was a one party state. Okay. Mhm. So now multipartism has grown legs. It's it's it's it's an adolesccent. It has grown legs. Yes. It can actually walk. It's now running. Yes. And then someone wants to tell you, \"Oh, we've been captured.\" No, no, no. You haven't been captured. You have betrayed the people who actually gave you their power to represent them with you have now given that power to somebody else against the wishes of the people who gave it to you. That is the reality. Now I want to ask a question because okay parliament we have agreed them. They sold their birthight. It's unfortunate. However, I am inclined to agree with Dr. Ambai here. Why? Because let's look at some of the issues the government has been facing. Um the president rather has been facing all these committees that he's been coming up with. Then all these issues with the judiciary whereby the judiciary says one thing president decides you know he can do something different about it. then um committees here or commissions here that have been formed to do do what and then people go to court and then the court blocks that particular um committee or commission yet the government has got people who I am assuming are are equally learned as the judges who make these decisions in court don't they advise the president tell the president look there's no way you'll form a committee on check in ABCD because eu it's not constitutional we have doras the ag and many other people Chumba is is as a as a as a as a lawyer and many other people professor Kur Kind Kind sorry um and who else um professor these are learned individuals people who've attained you know whatever the highest levels of law degrees so I'll tell you this either they also don't understand the law or something is wrong from what I have observed over time just my own observation the the data gathering method I use was observation is that the presidency is usually not as simple as we think it is we have this idea of what it is and then there's what it is a president relies on other people for that presidency to stay put this reliance is where the problem comes in because these people act as a filter in many ways. The president can't know everything even if they told there are people who will be running interference with the information they've been given. Plus these are people who will also understand that these information gatherers they have their people among them. So you're dealing with a situation that is not quite what we see it as. He's we simplified by saying oh but he gets information. Yes. Then there's implementation. Then put that on hold. Then there is the reality of what the economy is at. We had that discussion with Dr. Mai yesterday and he said the honest conversation as far as I'm concerned is not to treat the current government as a standalone government that isn't influenced by what the previous government did and the one before it. If you do not take that reality into consideration and since the discussion here begins and ends with actually money, we have to ask why is it that we the government seems to be struggling with money. Why? Because that's the struggle. The universities are discussing it is money. When you talk about teachers capitation education money, it is money. When you hear the uh court talking, they are not funded adequately. inadequate. It is money. Why is it that we don't have enough money? We don't have enough money for a very simple reason. Some of it is being hoarded. People who have money are not spending. Mhm. There isn't enough money in the economy to go around. Mhm. Partly because of the way the government is borrowing money. Cuz when the government borrows money then it is safe to borrow lend the government because they'll pay you as opposed to you who might change even your ID and then go somewhere in the part of the country and disappear completely. But also the obligations of government that this government faces are a culmination of what the previous government had. They are called debts. Y okay you can push this can down the road and perhaps even just pay interest. And whether you do or not, if they are due and you must pay all of it, they're in the trillions of shillings that you pay. Now, if we know what we collect 2.3 trillion, 2.5 trillion, the times we've even collected three. If we even work with a figure of three and half of that is going to paying debt, you remain with a half of that amount and then you look at your budget and then we have this crazy budget where you're told your budget is 4 trillion. So already we have a problem. There's a deficit of 2.5 trillion deficit before you even start if you to meet the budget. So the discussion then why don't you budget with 1.5 trillion cuz that's what we have. That is a debate that is still ongoing. If we budget with 1.5 trillion and we are honest about that budget we do know education will just take half of that money. Education take around 600 billion. We know this. Yes. I'm trying to explain I'm trying to say that even that 600 billion I would venture to ask have we audited as to have we asked the question as to why we need 600 billion for education every budget that we have whether it is health whether it's education these monies that we budget for we take it for granted that the arithmetic is correct and we've understood really because those amounts are colossal and the amounts even if dispersed dispersed partially Mhm. The actionability of that is not reflected on the ground as we say. So if you're talking about a government and the reality of what is what are we talking about exactly because all these are realities. Um we're going to host um Professor Manora once again perhaps he will tell us the realities of government because I like the way he explains things um but sometimes I find them very conspiracy based. However, what I'm trying to say is I like his point of view. And to UASu, I wish you all the best in getting this government officials arrested. What I can tell you for free, it ain't happening. This is Radio Generation Nairobi. Are you ready? September 27th, the Shawarma Festival 2025 takes over Two Rivers Mall. Juicy beef, spicy chicken, bone veggie creations. Your ticket gives you three shuarmas, plus a full day of music, games, competitions, and safe spaces for healing. This is where flavor meets freedom. Don't miss it. Get your tickets at madfund.com. Radio Generation, 88.8 Nairobi. This is Radio Generation Traffic. All right. So, um where where are we? Oh, yeah. City and I are having a very interesting conversation over here. Gong road is looking tricky at this particular moment, but it's a very small stretch. I even it's like 300 m junctions. So this is I feel like this is usually the story at exactly between 6:30 and 6:45 complaints. So this is what I will want you to do for me. Um if you see anything on the roads and you think it is of significance. Yeah. Here is our um handle that is at radioenk across all socials. Right. Um literally I can assure you the the roads right now super clear. So if you're heading to work, I would suggest from 7 a.m. like this. I'm certain 100% traffic on radio generation. All right. City is telling me that the realities of running government by they are not as easy as am. No, they are not quite what you think it is, my friend. And let me tell you, even those who take these seats, there's what they think it is. Yes. Then they get there and they realize, my goodness gracious me, this thing is not quite what I thought. It never is what you thought it was. It never is. That's the point I'm trying to make. Okay. And then when you have the makings of something that looks like a coalition government where you brought in all these people who you promise things, it gets really complicated. But me, I'll say this as we get into the papers. Um, we like excusing. Oh no, we don't like but we we we we we will excuse the president to a certain extent. No, this is not exc don't excuse him. Okay, just look at the facts. Don't excuse him. Okay, this these are the facts. Some of the things that the president is dealing with right now, he inherited from previous governments and we will not run away from that fact. However, this same president, sorry, this same president that we would like to to put him in some kind of I don't know, it's not a bubble, but there somewhere we are placing him. And I feel like you know you've gone into the excuse bit. Just look at the facts. Uh don't don't deviate from the fact President William Samo Ruto was in Kbaki's government. He was a minister. He knew the inner workings of Gava because he was in cabinet and he saw what was happening there. Right. Up until of course the time Kbaki fired him. Then he was in President Uhuru's government. Yes. For 10 years he was the principal assistant. And we we will say that you know he was just assisting because there's nothing he could do. He didn't have executive powers until the president actually told him do ABCD. That is when he would do it. But what I'm saying is he was there. Okay. And he used to earn a salary from my taxes. When he became president there's no way we'll start saying but you know he inherited problems. So he did inherit fine but he knew those problems were there. If economists know, if you see Tuga as a as a media personality and a researcher, you know, and yet you are not even in government, you so if you know if I know and I was a student then surely what are we saying about um um the how government should be run. So should I should I should I v for presidency and then God you know God allows me to become president of this country and then I start saying why was you know me I didn't know R did this I didn't know who did this my goodness no I took this job so let me stop excuses the I want to just mention one thing and I'll repeat it there are realities of political positions that You will only know when you've taken the opposition. You will be theorizing about it when you want it cuz you actually haven't sat on that seat. So you don't know. You only know what it is when you're there. Believe me, before you have an idea of what it is when you sit there, that's when you get to know ...",

Heat. Heat. N. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, man. Heat. Heat. Hey baby. Hey, hey, hey. Hey Hey. Okay. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. N. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Please welcome founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg LP, Michael R. Bloomberg. Hello. Well, hello everyone and welcome to the Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Forum. Uh, great ways to kick it off. A silverhead heartthrob with movie star charisma and also Harrison Ford. As a matter of fact, I thought that would work. Seriously, let me begin by and incidentally Harrison Ford I know very well. He's a pilot. I'm a pilot. we swapped war stories. Um, a great actor and a really nice guy and very thank thanks to him for doing this. Uh, let me begin by thanking everyone for taking the time to be here, including the heads of state and national delegations. This is a busy week every year with so many leaders gathered here in New York City for the UN General Assembly and there's certainly no shortage of challenges to discuss over there. But the truth is in a world that's more interconnected and fastm moving than ever before the biggest problems can't be solved by national governments alone. And that's what brings this forum together with leaders from business, philanthropy, nonprofits and government. Uh here we are united not as nations but as problem solvers, innovators and doers all bound by a belief that collaboration across the public and private sectors is essential to shared success. No group has all of the answers or all of the resources that we need, but we know that connections fueled progress and today we're here to make more of both. At Bloomberg Philanthropies, we've seen the power of collaboration and partnership. It's at the heart of everything that we do. Our mission is to help the greatest number of people live longer, better lives. In pursuit of that goal, we look for needs that aren't yet met and opportunities that have been overlooked, and we work to bring people together to take them on, just like we're doing here today. Let me give you one example. If you're wearing glasses or contact lenses, you know that what a lifecher they can be. I wear contact lenses and without it, I couldn't read. I couldn't see very well. But in the 21st century, there's no reason why anyone anywhere should have to struggle with fixable vision problems. And yet around 1 billion people do. Poor vision makes it harder for children to succeed in school and it limits people's ability to work and earn a living. And we can't accept that, especially when the solutions are already at hand. Earlier this year, we launched a new effort to bring people together and treat preventable vision problems. Working with partners, we've expanded access to vision screening and training health care professionals to perform cataract surgery. We also distributed more well we will also distribute more than 7 million free pairs of new glasses in countries around the world including here in the United States and I'm glad to announce that one of our lead partners will be an innovative eyeglass company based here in New York City Warby Parker it's an yes they deserve a it is an incredible promising partnership and let me thank everyone at Warby Parker Parker who has been part of it especially its CEO Neil Blumenthal who's with us today. Nice round of applause for him. We're also joined by two outstanding partners working with us on the ground to deliver eye glasses and screenings. the CEO of SL site slavers, Caroline Harper, and the CEO of Vision Spring, Ella Goodwin. Nice round of applause for them. Now, the world is full of opportunities to make a difference, and sometimes they're hiding in plain sight, if you don't mind the pun. Today, we're bringing more of them into focus. Same thing, and begin to form partnerships. It takes tough to re write this stuff uh and they form partnerships that really can fully seize them. We have a great group of distinguished guests and speakers with us. Uh we here are here to change the world. We are doing it. We're going to continue to do it. Bloomberg Philanthropies is honored to be part of it and we would love as much help as any of you can provide. Just give us a call. To get us started, we'll dive right into a subject with implications for virtually every other topic that we're going to cover today with so much potential to change the world we live in and work in. And that's advances in artificial intelligence. Every single story you read talks about artificial intelligence. And we're joined by a leader and innovator who has had an extraordinary career helping to guide big organizations through periods of rapid change. She's the president and chief investment officer at Alphabet and Google. And we're lucky to have her on the board at Bloomberg Philanthropies, Ruth Borat, and she'll be joined in conversation by a longstanding member of the team at Bloomberg News, Francine Laqua. Let's give them both a big warm welcome. Mike, thank you. Thank you so much. Welcome everyone. I hope everyone's having a great day with Poor Ed. I'm so happy to speak to you because AI could change everything for the good, maybe for the worse at certain parts. But where do you think we are in 2025 in terms of advancing technologies and AI, but also adoption? First, great to be here. This is always a wonderful event. So delighted to be here. Look, I think where we are with AI is it is both moving really fast and really slow. And what I mean by that is when you focus on the science, the breakthroughs in science are breathtaking. The pace at which we're seeing advancement. And I think one of the best ways to think about that is actually with my colleague Demisabus who runs Google deep mind and the work he did to develop something called alphafold which is the 3D prediction of protein structures u which is viewed as the single greatest contribution to drug discovery in our lifetime and he went from working on that he's been in neuros neuroscience and and computer science physics for his whole life but four years ago started on this journey to take on what had been a 50-year grand challenge to predict protein structure of uh the protein structures for all known proteins. And in four years he went from an idea that people challenged is it possible and he said why not to a solution which has now been open- sourced three million scientists around the world are using it 190 countries and the Nobel Prize that is the speed of change and we're seeing that across Google Deep Mine what is slow is actually the implementation in both the public and the private sector we're still very early days the excitement about AI is across the board the economic upside four trillion potential contribution to GDP by 2030 with proper application across industry and the public sector what's called diffusion. It's the better delivery of healthcare, better delivery of education and that is still very early days. AI is clearly a lot more than a chatbot. It's about a fundamental rethink of the processes that we have and I would say for each one of us as leaders, we need to start on that journey. So why do you think Ruth adoption is so slow or slower compared to the innovation? Is it because it's capital intensive and chief executives or even countries don't really know where to go next? I think one of the key elements is the prioritization. Where do I begin? Yeah. And I hear that time and time again. And the mental model I keep coming back to the framework actually anchors on health for a host of reasons. One, I think it is so relevant to each one of us. I've had cancer twice and so I look at the application of AI in health care and there's so much reason to be optimistic but when you then think through what are the solutions how do I prioritize actually the insights from health are relevant across all industries so first is saving lives it's innovation it's drug discovery I've already talked about that with alphafold but very importantly what demis said when he was awarded the Nobel prize is I want to take on the most intractable problems And when he was challenged as to whether it was possible, his answer was why not? And I think that's the way we each need to look at innovation regardless of industry. The second is obviously in healthcare early detection is the difference between survival and not in many cases or a really difficult course of treatment. And what is it in cancer? Google pioneered the early detection of metastatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and more. And that is literally proverbial the proverbial needle in a hay stack. finding that early sign of a problem. That is precisely what we do across many different applications. Cyber security is about finding the needle in the haststack. In fact, last year Google DeepMind found with AI that they could see vulnerabilities, find vulnerabilities in software before they were breached. So again, it is fortifying what you were doing in in cyber security. It's true for fraud, etc. And then finally, it's about operating effectiveness. Shortage of doctors and nurses around the globe. What we found with AI is you can free them from about 30% of their work, the administrative basically drudgery. Um, so they can do what we want as patients, focus on you as a patient, focus on what they want to be doing. And again, that is true across public and private sector. And I just was with a CEO this week who said, \"Yes, the application of AI customer support.\" What they're hearing from their employees is, \"Thank you for freeing me from that drudgery.\" And they can do higher level work and it unlocks capital that can then go into innovation. So I think prioritization is key. I think for everyone in this room, each one of us actually getting tactile with AI so that you can see how it's used. I learned how to vibe\r\n",
